This is a client side game.
where 2 players can play one after the other.

Game Rules:
1. Get ready :)
2. Four consecutive balls should match of the same colour horizontally, vertically or diagonally ( either of both)  just like tic-tat-toe.
3. That's it now u r ready to play the game :)
New ideas are welcome always!!
