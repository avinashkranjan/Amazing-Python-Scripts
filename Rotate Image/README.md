# RotateImage
Implementation of LeetCode Problem #47 in Python

## Description
RotateImage is a fun project that implements the solution to LeetCode Problem #47: Rotate Image. The goal of this project is to rotate an image (represented as a 2D matrix) by 90 degrees clockwise. The input image must be square in dimension (i.e., the number of rows and columns must be equal).

## Usage
To use this script, ensure that your input image is a square matrix. The script will output the rotated image.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Numpy
- PIL

## Installation
