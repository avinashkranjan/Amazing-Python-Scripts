# Facebook Profile Picture Downloader

Download the profile picture of any public profile on Facebook by its Facebook id.
<br>

## How it works:

* Just run the script by entering the Facebook id (valid Facebook-user-id) and get the profile-pictures stored in your local file.
* The Facebook id can be thought of as a unique Facebook-user-id of any profile existing on Facebook.
* This method allows to download profile pictures from only those profile, which are made public along with no profile picture guard set.
* The profiles begin to exist on Facebook from Facebook user id=4. No profile pictures will get downloaded for Facebook ids below 4, since there exists no such Facebook user id.
* The profile pictures will only get downloaded if the respective Facebook profile exists for the corresponding Facebook user id entered (the profile does may/may not exist for every numerical value).
* User-id-4 is for the Facebook id of [Mark Zuckerberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg)
