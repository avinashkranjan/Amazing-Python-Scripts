# Cartooning Image with OpenCV

We aim to transform images into its cartoon. Yes, we will CARTOONIFY the images. Thus, we will build a python application that will transform an image into its cartoon using OpenCV.


## What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is an open-source python library used for computer vision and machine learning. It is mainly aimed at real-time computer vision and image processing. It is used to perform different operations on images which transform them using different techniques.
In this article, we will try to perform some image transformation using the CV2 version of OpenCV.

## We will install opencv and numpy using the code below:
 ```shell
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```

## Now, we will import required libraries that are cv2 and numpy using the code given below:
 ```shell
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

## Here's an example of cartooning the image:
