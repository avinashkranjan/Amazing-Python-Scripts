# Base-N Calculator

It is a GUI based script that allows user to enter a number of any base and convert it to another. However, there is a small limitation for the conversion.

* The base should not be smaller than 2.
* Alphabetic symbols are not used in conversions, you'll have to convert this part by yourself. To know why check this [link](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/bases.html)

# Installation

Nothing to be installed, just run the script directly.

# Usage

1) Fill the required fields.
2) the conversion result will be displayed in the Result Entry.

# Output
