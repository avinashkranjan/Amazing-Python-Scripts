## Text Extraction
In this script we are going to read a real-time captured image using a web cam or any other camera and extract the text from that image by removing noise from it.
This script uses `OpenCV` for capturing the real-time image and `pytesseract` for text extraction from the captured image.

## Setup instructions

#### You can use this in two ways
* If your machine has any python intrepretor than you can go for [**Real-time Text Extraction**](https://github.com/ShubhamGupta577/Amazing-Python-Scripts/blob/Extracting-text-from-a-real-time-captured-image/Realtime%20Text%20Extraction/Realtime%20Text%20Extraction.py)
  * For these you need to install **OpenCV**, **pytesseracrt** and **PIL** in your machine.
* Another way is to use the [**Google Colab file**](https://github.com/ShubhamGupta577/Amazing-Python-Scripts/blob/Extracting-text-from-a-real-time-captured-image/Realtime%20Text%20Extraction/Realtime_Text_Extracion.ipynb) which will be excecute on a cloud. No need of any external downloading
* Just download the files and follow the instructions given in the files
