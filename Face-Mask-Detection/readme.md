### Introduction:
- Face mask detection had seen significant progress in the domains of Image processing and Computer vision, since the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been created using several algorithms and techniques. The approach in this project uses deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to detect face masks.
- Convolutional Neural Network, Data augmentation are the key to this project.

### Setup Instructions:
- This project contains datset with large number of data so all the datsets(Training, Testing, Validation) are put in a file named 'Dataset.rar'. This file needs to be extracted before proceeding with the project.
- The python script is fully made using Kaggle kernel. Anyone proceeding with the script are suggested to use Kaggle kernel, Google Colab, or Jupyter Notebook to run the script smoothly.
- All the datasets from the file 'Dataset.rar' should be uploaded, then the path is used in the script.
### Requirements:
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- opencv
- keras
- sklearn

Install all the modules listed under 'Requirements' section.
