# Guessing Game GUI
 _A random number is generated between an upper and lower limit both entered by the user. The user has to enter a number and the algorithm checks if the number matches or not within three attempts._

## Modules used

- tkinter
- random

## How it works

- User enters the upper limit and lower limit number (example 7 and 10) and locks these numbers.
- When the user locks these numbers a random number in the given range is generated by the random module.
- User guesses a number and enters it.
- The GUI displays if the number is correct or wrong within three attempts.
- After three attempts the user can either *play again* or *quit*
