Python script that adds a watermark image to a video. It uses the OpenCV library to read the input video, resize and position the watermark image, and then write the watermarked frames to an output video file. You can adjust the position parameter to change where the watermark will appear in the video frames. The script will read the input video, apply the watermark to each frame, and create the watermarked output video.
