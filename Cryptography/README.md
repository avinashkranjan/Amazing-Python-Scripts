# CRYPTOGRAPHY


## DESCRIPTION
The objective of this project is to encode and decode messages using a common key. In this project, users have to enter the message to encode or decode. Users have to select the mode to choose the encoding and decoding process. The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.


## PROJECT REQUISITES
To build this project we will use the basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.

- Tkinter is a standard GUI python library.
- base64 module provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.
- Tkinter is a standard GUI python library base64 module that provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.


## PROJECT STRUCTURE
These are the step to build message encode – decode python project-

- Import module
- Create display window
- Define function
- Define labels and buttons
