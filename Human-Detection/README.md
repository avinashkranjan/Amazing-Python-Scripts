## Image Processing

Image Processing is most commonly termed as 'Digital Image Processing' and the domain in which it is frequently used is 'Computer Vision'.

Both Image Processing algorithms and Computer Vision (CV) algorithms take an image as input; however, in image processing,the output is also an image, whereas in computer vision the output can be some features/information about the image.
