Description: This Python script is a simple port scanner that allows you to scan a target IP address for open ports within a specific range (from port 1 to port 99).This script serves as a basic port scanner that helps identify open ports on a target system and can be useful for network diagnostics and security assessments. However, it is essential to note that some systems might block port scanning activities, and performing scanning without proper authorization is unethical and potentially illegal. Always ensure you have proper permission before scanning any network or system.
