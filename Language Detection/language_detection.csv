" Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.",English
"""Nature"" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.",English
"The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.",English
"Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.",English
"[1] The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"".",English
"[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.",English
"[3][4] 
The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.",English
"During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.",English
"[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).",English
"However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.",English
"[1] Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife.",English
"Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.",English
"It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.",English
"For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, ""human nature"" or ""the whole of nature"".",English
"This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.",English
"Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.",English
"[1] Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research.",English
"Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall.",English
"Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.",English
"[7] Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre.",English
71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans.,English
"The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.",English
Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions.,English
The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates.,English
"The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field.",English
"This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase.",English
"Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.",English
"The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[8] which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.",English
"Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[9] and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.",English
[10][11] Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the earth.,English
"The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed.",English
"The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.",English
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.,English
Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock.,English
"Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface.",English
"Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.",English
"After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.",English
"Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion.",English
"These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.",English
"Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets.",English
[12] The moon formed roughly 20 million years later.,English
"Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust.",English
Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.,English
"Condensing water vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources.",English
[13] The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.,English
"[14] Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent.",English
"Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart.",English
"The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540 million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180 million years ago.",English
"[16] During the Neoproterozoic era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice sheets.",English
"This hypothesis has been termed the ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540 million years ago.",English
[17] Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.,English
"[18] The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals.",English
"Over the past 66 million years, mammalian life diversified.",English
"[19] Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.",English
"[15] The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.",English
"By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300 million years to culminate.",English
"The present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred.",English
"[20][21] Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100 years.",English
"[22] The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.",English
[23][24][25] The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem.,English
The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.,English
"Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc.",English
The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude.,English
The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface.,English
"As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface.",English
"The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.",English
"Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.",English
"[26] Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.",English
These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones.,English
"Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.",English
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects.,English
"Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation.",English
"Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.",English
Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather.,English
"Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit.",English
"Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.",English
"The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially latitude.",English
A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region.,English
"There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes.",English
"Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane.",English
"Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun.",English
This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit.,English
"At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.",English
"Weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days.",English
"[27] Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.",English
[28] Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.,English
"[29] In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam.",English
Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.,English
"[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.",English
"[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%.",English
"Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.",English
"An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere.",English
"Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas.",English
"More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep.",English
"Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.",English
"Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.",English
[33][34] This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.,English
"[35] The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.",English
"Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names.",English
"There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean.",English
Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.,English
"A lake (from Latin word lacus) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all.",English
"On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.",English
"[36][37] The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane.",English
"It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds.",English
"Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation.",English
Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers.,English
"In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.",English
"All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.",English
"A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.",English
"A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.",English
Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed.,English
"While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents.",English
"These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.",English
"A river is a natural watercourse,[38] usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.",English
"In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water.",English
"Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river.",English
Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England.,English
"Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.",English
[39] A river is part of the hydrological cycle.,English
"Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).",English
"A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks.",English
"In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide.",English
"Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration.",English
The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone.,English
"Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity.",English
"The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.",English
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way.,English
[41] The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.,English
Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem.,English
"Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.",English
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment.,English
"Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: ""Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the ""community"") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.",English
: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.,English
"""[42] Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain, and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment.",English
"[43] The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature dichotomy and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope.",English
[44] A smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem.,English
"For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it.",English
"A macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.",English
[45] Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity.,English
"Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, national forests, national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas.",English
"Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, and solitude.",English
"Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,[46] and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere).",English
"They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.",English
"Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction.",English
[47] Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.,English
"Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce.",English
An entity with these properties is generally considered life.,English
"However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential.",English
Human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.,English
"The biosphere is the part of Earth's outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform.",English
"From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air).",English
"The entire Earth contains over 75 billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013 kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.",English
"[48] Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.",English
"[49] More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,[50] and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50 million.",English
"[51][52][53] The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.",English
[54][55] The total number of species is in rapid decline.,English
"[56][57][58] The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago,[61][62][63] during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.",English
[64] These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits.,English
"Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.",English
Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct.,English
"However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species.",English
Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.,English
[64] When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.,English
[65] The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer.,English
The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.,English
"[66] Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms.",English
"With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.",English
"The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.",English
"[67] Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see.",English
"They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.",English
"These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.",English
"[68]
Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse.",English
"The combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer[69] ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including outer space.",English
[70] They form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem.,English
"However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.",English
"Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals.",English
"In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia.",English
"Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms.",English
"However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts.",English
"Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,[71][72] and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.",English
"Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil flora, remnants of plant life from a previous era.",English
"People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain.",English
"Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as native flora and agricultural and garden flora, the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated.",English
"Some types of ""native flora"" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced.",English
This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.,English
Another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds.,English
"Though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize ""useless"" plants, the informal use of the word ""weeds"" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature.",English
"Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as domestic, farm animals, wild animals, pests, etc.",English
according to their relationship to human life.,English
Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things.,English
"Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists.",English
"They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae.",English
"They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.",English
With a few exceptions—most notably the two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoans—animals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues.,English
"These include muscles, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a nervous system, which sends and processes signals.",English
There is also typically an internal digestive chamber.,English
The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.,English
"This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.",English
"Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large.",English
"Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and ""made environments"" is not clear cut except at the extremes.",English
"Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.",English
The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards.,English
"In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment.",English
There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.,English
"[73] Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills.",English
Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.,English
Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities.,English
The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.,English
"[74][75] Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people.",English
Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE.,English
"Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.",English
"Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,[76] most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.",English
"The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.",English
"[77] Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores.",English
"That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty.",English
"Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics.",English
"Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.",English
[78] Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history.,English
An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).,English
The tradition of representing nature as it is became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.,English
"Although natural wonders are celebrated in the Psalms and the Book of Job, wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the Romantic movement.",English
British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings.,English
"Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings.",English
"William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place.",English
Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.,English
[79] This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world.,English
"A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis, the imitation of nature.",English
Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature.,English
"As David Rothenburg writes, ""The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see"".",English
"[80]:281 Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand.",English
"For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be ""physics""—the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the ""study of nature"".",English
Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed.,English
It constitutes the observable universe.,English
The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass.,English
The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy.,English
[81] The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.,English
The behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws.,English
These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe.,English
The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants[82] that appear to be static across the observable universe.,English
"[83] The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.",English
"Outer space, also simply called space, refers to the relatively empty regions of the Universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies.",English
Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations).,English
"There is no discrete boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude.",English
"Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at what is known as the heliopause.",English
"Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.",English
"There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors.",English
"Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft.",English
Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.,English
"Although Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.",English
"[84] For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life.",English
"At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.",English
"If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.",English
"[85] Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it.",English
"But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.",English
"[86] Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar Earth analogs – planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.",English
[87] Media: Organizations: Philosophy:   Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (listen) wik-ee-) is a multilingual open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system.,English
"It is one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, as of January 2021[update][3] and The Economist newspaper placed it as the ""13th-most-visited place on the web"".",English
"[4] Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.",English
"Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.",English
"Sanger coined its name[5][6] as a portmanteau of ""wiki"" and ""encyclopedia"".",English
"It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed.",English
"With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the 317 Wikipedia encyclopedias.",English
"Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles,[7] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.",English
"[8][9] Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male.",English
[4] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.,English
"[10] In 2006, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.",English
"[11] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability, based on its unique structure, curation and absence of commercial bias.",English
"[4] In 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.",English
"[12] Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful.",English
"[13] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.",English
"[14] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company.",English
"Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.",English
"[15][16] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.",English
"[17] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[18][19] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.",English
"[20] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.",English
"[21] The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001,[22] and January 13, 2001,[23] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[14] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[24] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.",English
"[18] Wikipedia's policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[25] was codified in its first few months.",English
"Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.",English
"[18] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.",English
"[26] Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing.",English
"Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 by the end of 2004.",English
"[27] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia.",English
"The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made during the Ming Dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.",English
"[28] Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.",English
"[29] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.",English
"[30][31] Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.",English
"[32] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.",English
[33] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.,English
"[34] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called ""low-hanging fruit""—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.",English
"[35][36][37]  In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.",English
[38][39] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.,English
"[40] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.",English
"[41] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from ""a little more than 36,000 writers"" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011.",English
"In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".",English
"[42] A 2013 article titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" in MIT Technology Review questioned this claim.",English
"The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae.",English
"[43] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline.",English
"[44] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated ""Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis"".",English
"[45] In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list of the most popular websites in the US, according to comscore Networks.",English
"With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11).",English
"This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was number 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors.",English
"[46] As of March 2020[update], Wikipedia has rank 13[3] among websites in terms of popularity according to Alexa Internet.",English
"In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month.",English
"[47] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ""according to the ratings firm comScore"".",English
"[8] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through ""stigmergic accumulation"".",English
"[48][49]  On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.",English
[50] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content.,English
"[51][52] On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it ""had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year.",English
There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013.,English
"Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.",English
"""[53] Varma added that ""While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.",English
"""[53] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, ""If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].",English
"""[53] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most popular websites globally.",English
"[54] In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument; and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia.",English
"In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.",English
"[55][56] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia have been encoded into synthetic DNA.",English
"[57] Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle[note 3] regarding the security of its content.",English
"[60] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account.",English
Modifications to all articles would be published immediately.,English
"As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.",English
"Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases.",English
"For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.",English
"[61] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.",English
"[62][63] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.",English
[64] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.,English
"[65] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page protection policies as ""[p]erhaps the most important"" means at Wikipedia's disposal to ""regulate its market of ideas"".",English
"[66] In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions.",English
"For example, the German Wikipedia maintains ""stable versions"" of articles,[67] which have passed certain reviews.",English
"Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the ""pending changes"" system in December 2012.",English
"[68] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.",English
"[69] Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others.",English
"The ""History"" page of each article links to each revision.",English
"[note 4][70] On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page.",English
"Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a ""watchlist"" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes.",English
"""New pages patrol"" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.",English
"[71] In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor ""creative construction"" over ""creative destruction"".",English
[72] Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism.,English
The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor.,English
Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam.,English
[73] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page.,English
"Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect.",English
"Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.",English
[74] Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.,English
"[75][76] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.",English
"[77] In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005.",English
Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F.,English
Kennedy.,English
[77] The article remained uncorrected for four months.,English
"[77] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation.",English
"Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.",English
"[78][79] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as ""a flawed and irresponsible research tool"".",English
"[77] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.",English
"[80] In 2010, Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0, to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will.",English
"On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing.",English
"[81][82] Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as ""edit warring"".",English
[83][84] The process is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.,English
"[85] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[86] conflict based[87] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[88] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.",English
Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests.,English
"Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.",English
"Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the ""five pillars"" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.",English
"Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.",English
[89] Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.,English
"Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia.",English
They have since diverged to some extent.,English
"[67] According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.",English
"[90] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of ""notability"",[91] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.",English
"Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.",English
[92] It must not present original research.,English
A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source.,English
"Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as ""verifiability, not truth"" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.",English
"[93] This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.",English
"[94] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.",English
"[95] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.",English
This is known as a neutral point of view (NPOV).,English
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.,English
"[96][97] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.",English
"[98] Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with ""administrator"",[99][100] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing.",English
"Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).",English
"[101][102] Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.",English
[103] Bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.,English
"Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances.",English
"To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,[note 5] or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a ""request for comment"".",English
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process.,English
"Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.",English
"Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[104] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.",English
"Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).",English
"Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).",English
Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.,English
"When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.",English
"[105] Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated ""Talk"" page.",English
"These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.",English
"[106] Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[107] although not always with entirely negative connotations.",English
"[108] The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as ""anti-elitism"".",English
[109] Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work.,English
"These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work.",English
[110] Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.,English
"[111] As Wikipedia grew, ""Who writes Wikipedia?""",English
became one of the questions frequently asked on the project.,English
"[112] Jimmy Wales once argued that only ""a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers"" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore ""much like any traditional organization"".",English
"[113] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: ""According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.",English
"""[114] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.",English
"[115] The English Wikipedia has 6,238,672 articles, 40,838,998 registered editors, and 141,020 active editors.",English
An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.,English
"Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions.",English
"Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a ""baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references"".",English
"[116] Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,[116] as ""participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation"",[117] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.",English
"A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site"".",English
"[118] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that ""[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.",English
"""[113] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by ""outsiders"", while most editing and formatting is done by ""insiders"".",English
"[113] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[119][120] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.",English
"[121] According to a 2009 study, there is ""evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content"".",English
[122] Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male.,English
"Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.",English
"[123] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage females to become Wikipedia contributors.",English
"Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.",English
"[124] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, wrote in The New York Times that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ""ugly, intimidating behavior"".",English
[125] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.,English
"[126] There are currently 317 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias).",English
"As of January 2021, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, Swedish, German, French, and Dutch Wikipedias.",English
"[127] The second and third largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013 had created about half the articles in the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias.",English
The latter are both languages of the Philippines.,English
"In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Waray, Vietnamese, Japanese, Egyptian Arabic, Chinese, Arabic, Ukrainian and Portuguese), seven more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Serbian, Indonesian, Norwegian (Bokmål), Korean and Finnish), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000.",English
"[128][129] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.2 million articles.",English
"As of January 2019[update], according to Alexa, the English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia) receives approximately 57% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Russian: 9%; Chinese: 6%; Japanese: 6%; Spanish: 5%).",English
"[3] Distribution of the 55,727,399 articles in different language editions (as of January 30, 2021)[130] The unit for the numbers in bars is articles.",English
"Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition).",English
These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g.,English
colour versus color)[132] or points of view.,English
"[133] Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as ""neutral point of view"", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.",English
"[134][135][136] Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language"".",English
"[137] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all.",English
"They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).",English
"[138] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[139] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.",English
"[140] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.",English
It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition.,English
"For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.",English
"Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles.",English
"[142] Articles available in more than one language may offer ""interwiki links"", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.",English
A study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world.,English
"It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia.",English
"[141] On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled ""The Future of Wikipedia"", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that ""[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.",English
"""[143] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia).",English
"The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down.",English
"The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.",English
"Should this attrition have continued unabated at the quoted trend rate of approximately 20,000 editors lost within seven years, by 2021 there would be only 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia.",English
"[143] In contrast, the trend analysis published in The Economist presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000.",English
[143] No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.,English
"[144] Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014[update].",English
[145][146] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias.,English
"In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of ""truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods"".",English
"[147] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.",English
"[148][149][150] Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an ""ax to grind"" on the topic.",English
"[147][151] A 2008 article in Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.",English
"[152] In 2006, the Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism in the English Wikipedia.",English
"[153] Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.",English
"[154] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that ""the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.",English
"""[155] Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects ""a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors"" in science articles, ""Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.",English
"""[156] Others raised similar critiques.",English
"[157] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica,[158][159] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.",English
"[160] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a ""flawed study design"" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study ""statistical power"" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).",English
"[161] As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia ""makes no guarantee of validity"" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.",English
"[162] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity,[163] the insertion of false information,[164] vandalism, and similar problems.",English
"Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: ""If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.""",English
"He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports.",English
"However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.",English
[165] Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.,English
"[166] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.",English
[167] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.,English
"[168] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of ""fake news"" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.",English
"[169] Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.",English
"[70][171]
In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal, to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.",English
"[172] The article stated that: ""Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement.",English
"Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.",English
"'""[172][173][174][175][176] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.",English
"[177] A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a ""general source"" that ""can be a real boon"" in ""coming up to speed in the law governing a situation"" and, ""while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources"".",English
"[178] Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[179] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.",English
"[180][181] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.",English
[182] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved.,English
"""For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia,"" he said.",English
"[183] In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.",English
"[184] In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google,[185] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are ""the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything"".",English
"In contrast, academic writing[clarification needed] in Wikipedia has evolved in recent years and has been found to increase student interest, personal connection to the product, creativity in material processing, and international collaboration in the learning process.",English
"[186] On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled ""Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia"", stated that ""Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.",English
"""[187] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.",English
"[187] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled ""Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?",English
""", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: ""Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.",English
"""[188] Beck added that: ""Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'.",English
"Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.",English
"""[188] In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that the quality of a Wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit coordination.",English
"[189] For instance, when contributors rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry.",English
"Roy Rosenzweig, a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its ""clear and engaging prose"", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing.",English
"[190] Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online, he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised ""McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.""",English
"By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds ""both verbose and dull"".",English
"Rosenzweig also criticized the ""waffling—encouraged by the NPOV policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history"".",English
"While generally praising the article on William Clarke Quantrill, he quoted its conclusion as an example of such ""waffling"", which then stated: ""Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero.",English
"""[190] Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style.",English
"Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented, ""Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 percent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage.",English
"""[191] A study of Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University.",English
"The study was limited to those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluded those written at the ""start"" class or ""stub"" class level.",English
"Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that ""Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing"".",English
"[192] The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: ""inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information"".",English
"[193] Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article.",English
"Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.",English
"[194] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).",English
"[195][196] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.",English
"The 'Wikipedia is not censored' policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy.",English
"The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[197] and Pakistan,[198] amongst other countries.",English
A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field:[199] These numbers refer only to the number of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones.,English
"Through its ""Wikipedia Loves Libraries"" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.",English
[200] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics.,English
"There was a greater concentration of females in the People and Arts category, while males focus more on Geography and Science.",English
[201] Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven.,English
Africa is the most underrepresented.,English
"[202] Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.",English
[203] An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.,English
[204] Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address.,English
"[126] When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, systemic bias may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors.",English
"In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example ""biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare"".",English
"[42] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.",English
"[43] Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally,[vague] for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions.",English
"[205] It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture, inclining to be young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing.",English
"Biases, intrinsically, may include an overemphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events.",English
"[205] Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford, in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution.",English
[206][207] His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring.,English
"Yasseri contended that simple reverts or ""undo"" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting ""reverting/reverted pairs"" or ""mutually reverting edit pairs"".",English
"Such a ""mutually reverting edit pair"" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the ""mutually reverting edit pairs"".",English
The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia.,English
"The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism, and Muhammad.",English
"[207] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.",English
[207] Researchers from Washington University developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics.,English
"The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact.",English
[208][209] Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.,English
"Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.",English
"The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles.",English
It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.,English
"The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl.",English
The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries.,English
"In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a ""blacklist"" it supplies to British internet service providers.",English
"[210] In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.",English
"[211][212] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted ""obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children"", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.",English
[213] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.,English
[213] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.,English
"[214] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[215] saying that Wikipedia did not have ""material we would deem to be illegal.",English
"If we did, we would remove it.",English
"""[215] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community.",English
"After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status.",English
"He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".",English
"[216] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.",English
"[217] One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a ""private citizen"" rather than a ""public figure"" in the eyes of the law.",English
"[218][note 6] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life (""meatspace"").",English
A particular problem occurs in the case of a relatively unimportant individual and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.,English
"In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka ""Tron"", a deceased hacker.",English
"On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.",English
"[219] Wikipedia has a ""Volunteer Response Team"" that uses the OTRS system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties.",English
"This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.",English
[220] Wikipedia has been described as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment.,English
[221][222] The perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap in Wikipedia editors.,English
"[223] In 2014, a female editor who requested a separate space on Wikipedia to discuss improving civility had her proposal referred to by a male editor using the words ""the easiest way to avoid being called a cunt is not to act like one"".",English
"[221] Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks.",English
The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.,English
"[224] The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7 million and expenses of almost $29 million, with assets of $37.2 million and liabilities of about $2.3 million.",English
"[225] In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.",English
"[226] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, ""Information, like air, wants to be free.",English
"""[227][228] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who ""said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority.",English
'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.',English
"Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities,"" Walsh said.",English
"[227] Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the ""superprotection"" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.",English
[229] Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December.,English
"Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: ""It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words.",English
"""[230] Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates.",English
"These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimédia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups.",English
"These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.",English
"The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.",English
"[231] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection.",English
"MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.",English
"Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.",English
"Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske.",English
The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand.,English
"In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.",English
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed[232] to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.,English
"In April 2005, a Lucene extension[233][234] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching.",English
"The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1,[235][needs update] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3.",English
"[236] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.",English
"[237][238][239][240] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as ""slow and buggy"".",English
[241] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.,English
"Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.",English
"[242][243][244] One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson [sv], creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.",English
"[245] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).",English
[246] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors.,English
An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.,English
"[243] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was reported edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.",English
[247] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.,English
"[248] According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.",English
"[249] Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000-page requests per second, depending on the time of the day.",English
"[250][needs update] As of 2019[update], page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers.",English
"[251][needs update] Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available.",English
"[252] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.",English
"The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia.",English
"To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.",English
[citation needed] Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu).,English
"[253][254][needs update] As of December 2009[update], there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.",English
"[255] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia.",English
"[256][257] in 2017, Wikipedia had installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.",English
"[258] Following growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported,[43] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.",English
"[259] Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized ""Thank"" tab which were developed to ameliorate issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success.",English
"[43][241] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.",English
"[260] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.",English
"[260] In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by Bloomberg News as being at $77 million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.",English
"[260] Community-produced news publications include the English Wikipedia's The Signpost, founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator, and former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees.",English
"[261] It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikimedia Commons.",English
"Similar publications are the German-language Kurier, and the Portuguese-language Correio da Wikipédia.",English
"Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the Wikiworld webcomic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors.",English
There are also several publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as Wikimedia Diff and This Month in Education.,English
"When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.",English
[262] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL.,English
"This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.",English
"In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals.",English
The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web.,English
The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.,English
"[263] Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.",English
(A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.),English
"In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.",English
[264][265][266][267] The handling of media files (e.g.,English
image files) varies across language editions.,English
"Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g.",English
in Japanese copyright law).,English
Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g.,English
"Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.",English
Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.,English
"[268] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia.",English
This position has been successfully defended in court.,English
"[269][270] Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.",English
"The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.",English
"Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.",English
"[281] Wikipedia publishes ""dumps"" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007[update] there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images.",English
"[282] Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public.",English
"According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.",English
[283] Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection.,English
"Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.",English
"[8] The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, ""Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent.",English
And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.,English
"""[8] The New York Times reports that Möller has assigned ""a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile"", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation.",English
"One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the ""worry"" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.",English
[8] Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.,English
"[284] At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia.",English
"Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.",English
"[228] The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.",English
"[285] The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.",English
"[286] Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service.",English
"In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices.",English
"In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,[287] located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices or WebOS-based devices.",English
Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged.,English
"Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (see Wikipedia:Metadata), such as geoinformation.",English
[288][289] Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries.,English
[290] It was discontinued in February 2018.,English
[291] Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.,English
The number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this.,English
Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.,English
[43] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this.,English
Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.,English
"[292][293] In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.",English
"Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, ""YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.",English
"""[12] As of November 2020, Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.03 and the average daily time on site as 3:46 minutes.",English

"""[8] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.",English
"[294] In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[295] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.",English
"[296] About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google,[297] a good portion of which is related to academic research.",English
[298] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.,English
[299] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.,English
[300] In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.,English
"[301] According to ""Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011"", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders.",English
"Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results.",English
About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.,English
"[302] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.",English

The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.,English
[365][366] Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.,English
[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.,English
"Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.",English
"[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.",English
"A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning.",English
"The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.",English
"Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.",English
"[4][5] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.",English
Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.,English
It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks.,English
"For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed.",English
"For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms.",English
"In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.",English
[6] The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available.,English
"In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid.",English
This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers.,English
"For example, to train a system for the task of digital character recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has often been used.",English
"[6] Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to the learning system: Other approaches have been developed which don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.",English
"For example topic modeling, dimensionality reduction or meta learning.",English
"[7] As of 2020, deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning.",English
"[6] The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.",English
"[8][9] A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.",English
"[10] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.",English
"[11] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.",English
"[12] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.""[13] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms.",English
"This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?""",English
"is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".",English
"[14] Modern day machine learning has two objectives, one is to classify data based on models which have been developed, the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models.",English
A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles.,English
"Where as, a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.",English
"[15] As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence.",English
"In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data.",English
"They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.",English
"[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.",English
"[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning.",English
Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.,English
"[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.",English
"[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.",English
[19]:708–710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time.,English
"This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton.",English
Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.,English
"[19]:25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s.",English
The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature.,English
"It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.",English
"[20] As of 2020, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a subfield of AI.",English
"[21][22][16] The main disagreement is whether all of ML is part of AI, as this would mean that anyone using ML could claim they are using AI.",English
Others have the view that not all of ML is part of AI[23][24][25] where only an 'intelligent' subset of ML is part of AI.,English
[26] The question to what is the difference between ML and AI is answered by Judea Pearl in The Book of Why.,English
"[27] Accordingly ML learns and predicts based on passive observations, whereas AI implies an agent  interacting with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.",English
"[30] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases).",English
"Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy.",English
"Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge.",English
"Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.",English
Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.,English
"Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).",English
"[31] The difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.",English
"Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.",English
"Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.",English
"[32] According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.",English
[33] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.,English
"[33] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[34] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest.",English
"Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.",English
[35] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.,English
"[3][36] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set.",English
The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.,English
The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.,English
"Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms.",English
"Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common.",English
The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.,English
"For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data.",English
"If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data.",English
"If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases.",English
"But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.",English
"[37] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.",English
"In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time.",English
There are two kinds of time complexity results.,English
Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time.,English
Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.,English
"The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.",English
Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.,English
"[38] The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples.",English
"Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal.",English
"In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix.",English
"Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.",English
[39] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.,English
An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.,English
"[13] Types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.",English
"[40] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range.",English
"As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.",English
"Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are.",English
"It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.",English
"Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.",English
"The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized.",English
"Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.",English
"A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics, such as finding the probability density function.",English
[41] Though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.,English
"Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar.",English
"Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters.",English
Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.,English
Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data).,English
"Some of the training examples are missing training labels,  yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.",English
"In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.",English
[42] Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.,English
"Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms.",English
"In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP).",English
Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.,English
"[43] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible.",English
Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.,English
Self-learning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).,English
[44] It is a learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice.,English
"The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations.",English
The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.,English
"[45]
The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: It is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a.",English
There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment.,English
The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation.,English
"The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment.",English
"After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.",English
[46] Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.,English
[47] Classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis.,English
"Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions.",English
"This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution.",English
"This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.",English
Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised.,English
"In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data.",English
"Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning.",English
"In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data.",English
"Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization[48] and various forms of clustering.",English
[49][50][51] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.,English
"Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.",English
"Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.",English
"[52] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features.",English
It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.,English
[53] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process.,English
"However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features.",English
"An alternative is to discover such features or representations thorough examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.",English
"Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and is assumed to be a sparse matrix.",English
The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.,English
[54] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm.,English
Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts.,English
"In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs.",English
"For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary.",English
Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising.,English
"The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.",English
"[55] In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.",English
"[56] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.",English
"Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.",English
"[57] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity.",English
"This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless it has been aggregated appropriately.",English
"Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.",English
[58] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.,English
"[59] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set.",English
"Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection).",English
Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.,English
"In developmental robotics, robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans.",English
"These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies and imitation.",English
Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.,English
"It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"".",English
"[60] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge.",English
The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system.,English
This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.,English
"[61] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.",English
"Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.",English
"[62] For example, the rule

{\displaystyle \{\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \}\Rightarrow \{\mathrm {burger} \}}

 found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat.",English
Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements.,English
"In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics.",English
"In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.",English
"Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning.",English
They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.,English
"[63] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses.",English
"Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples.",English
"Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.",English
Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing.,English
Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.,English
[64][65][66] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.,English
"[67] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.",English
"Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions.",English
Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.,English
"Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.",English
"Such systems ""learn"" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.",English
"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.",English
"Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another.",English
An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.,English
"In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.",English
"The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"".",English
Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds.,English
The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection.,English
Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.,English
"Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers.",English
Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.,English
"Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.",English
The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would.,English
"However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology.",English
"Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.",English
Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network.,English
This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing.,English
Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.,English
[68] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).,English
"It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning.",English
"Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels.",English
Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.,English
"In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.",English
"In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.",English
"Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression.",English
"Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.",English
"[69]  An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting.",English
"In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.",English
Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features.,English
"Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares.",English
"The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression.",English
"When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.",English
"A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG).",English
"For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.",English
"Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.",English
Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning.,English
"Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks.",English
Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.,English
"A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.",English
"In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.",English
"[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.",English
"[73] Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well.",English
"Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set.",English
"Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service.",English
Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.,English
Trained models derived from biased data can result in skewed or undesired predictions.,English
Algorithmic bias is a potential result from data not fully prepared for training.,English
"Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server.",English
This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices.,English
"For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.",English
"[74] There are many applications for machine learning, including: In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%.",English
A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.,English
"[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.",English
[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.,English
"[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.",English
"[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.",English
[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.,English
"[81] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.",English
"[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.",English
"[85] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.",English
[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.,English
[87][88] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature.,English
"While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.",English
[89] Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases.,English
A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data.,English
"When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.",English
[90] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.,English
[91][92] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.,English
"[93][94] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[95] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.",English
[96] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.,English
"[97] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.",English
"[98] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.",English
"[99] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There’s nothing artificial about AI...It’s inspired by people, it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people.",English
"It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.”[100] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set.",English
"In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model.",English
"In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.",English
"[101] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively.",English
"Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR).",English
"However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.",English
The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability.,English
"TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).",English
[102] Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions.,English
"Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.",English
"[103] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.",English
[104][105] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.,English
The evolvement of AI systems raises a lot questions in the realm of ethics and morality.,English
"AI can be well equipped in making decisions in certain fields such technical and scientific which rely
heavily on data and historical information.",English
These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning.,English
"[106] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.",English
"[107][108] Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care.",English
There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines.,English
"This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits.",English
"For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes.",English
"There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.",English
"[109] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.",English
"[110] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.",English
"[111] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.",English
"[112][113] Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following: 
.we're all looking for quick ways to become more fluent in english i know i understand what happens is that there are just a few words circling our brain and we need to make this entire conversation using just awesome amazing cool or epic so how about we learn some smart new english words that you can use in your daily life and elevate your vocabulary in minutes.",English
so today we're going to learn 10 new smart words their meanings root words and example sentences so let's get going  hey everyone this is  and you're watching.,English
and in this video i'm gonna give you 10 smart words for daily use and at the end of this video.,English
i'm also going to give you a smart tip to sound really fluent smart word number.,English
one is swamped swamped means drowning or flooding but swamped is often used in the context of work like i'm swamped with work i have too much work to do i've been swamped with work this entire week i've barely had time to breathe now let's look at the root of this word.,English
swamp is a piece of wetland and if somebody steps in the wrong place on a swamp they could easily drown and the verb form of swamp means to sink so here's how you can use this word.,English
let's say you have a lot of assignments and you have a test coming up and your friends come to you and they say.,English
hey why don't you hang out with us you can say to them i'm so sorry but i'm swamped with work or i'm swamped some other words that you can use in place of swamped are i've got too much to do.,English
there's too much on my plate i'm drowning in work.,English
i'm deluged with assignments smart word number two is catch-22 now i'm sure you've heard this word before catch-22 means an impossible situation in which you can't do one thing unless you've done the other and you can't do the other because you haven't done the first have.,English
i confused you so let me give you some examples a catch-22 situation is when you don't get a job without having work experience.,English
but you can't get experience until you get a job catch-22 was coined by joseph heller in his famous book of the same name catch-22 when he was describing some contradictory rules that were applicable to soldiers during world war two.,English
another example of catch-22 is you need a bank loan because you don't have enough.,English
money but you wouldn't get that bank loan unless you prove to the bank that you have enough money so next time you're stuck in a tricky situation remember.,English
to use the word catch-22.,English
and get these admiring looks from your friends other words that you can use in place of catch-22 are paradox or dilemma smart word.,English
number three is suave suave suave means to be sophisticated to be polite poised cool and.,English
well-mannered the word suave has several different origins but one very interesting  origin of the word is which means pleasant or sweet tasting example.,English
he is so poised and suave especially in front of the ladies or barack obama is so suave and polished now remember when you're at a party next time and you see this person who's so.,English
well-mannered and cultured and sophisticated.,English
don't forget to say hey who's that suave guy right out there in the corner using this word will instantly make your vocabulary.,English
very suave so smart word number four is atrocious atrocious the word atrocious means something really bad horrible terrible cruel appalling offensive atrocious has a latin root called .which means fear cruel or terrible some examples of the word atrocious are the recent rape incidents in delhi were atrocious or prisoners are treated.,English
in an atrocious manner sometimes in prisons atrocious is also used in day to day life to talk about some common wrong doing and you want to exaggerate it.,English
for example his table manners were atrocious or her dress sense is so atrocious or his grammar is atrocious.,English
so the next time you hear of a horrific act on the news remember to.,English
"remark and say that this is an atrocious act smart word number 5 is stupendous, stupendous, stupendous, means amazing astonishing.",English
now we often use the word awesome here's another word that you can use in  place of awesome stupendous for example today i got a stupendous score on my test which means i got an a very high score or.,English
i got a near-perfect score the word stupendous has classical latin roots from the word which means.,English
to be stunned so stupendous is used to describe something that is stunningly good for example she looks stupendous in that dress or what a stupendous view from this balcony or i'm reading this stupendous book that i can't put down how about you go and tell.,English
your friends that is this stupendous channel for students and some other words that you can use instead of stupendous are incredible fantastic or exceptionally good ok so before we continue with the balanced five words on this video remember to put a comment under this video.,English
to tell me which of these ten words was your favorite smart word number six is in a fix in a fix means to be in a troublesome situation for example boy i'm in a fix because i've made plans with two different friends for this evening.,English
i've lost my phone and i'm in a fix or our bus broke down this morning and i'm in a fix my friend always turns to me for help when he's in a fix and when the going is good he forgets about.,English
me so the next time you get math homework from school for example and if you've left your math book in school then you can tell your friends that you're in a real fix now you may think that the word fix has something to do with repairing something.,English
but no in a fix means to be in a troublesome situation other words that you can use instead of in a fix are i'm in a soup or i'm in a mess or i'm in a spot of bother or just i'm in a spot smart word number 7 is flummox flummox means to confuse someone.,English
so much that they forget what to do now confused tends to be an overused word so instead of that why don't you use flummox for example the boy looked completely .flummoxed when the teacher asked him a question in class or the dog was flummoxed looking at his own reflection in the mirror or the tourist was flummoxed by the different customs that.,English
he encountered during his travels or in an interview when she was asked why should we hire you she looked completely flummoxed so next time if you get confused on any questions for example in an examination then you.,English
can always say that because i hadn't prepared very well for the exam i was flummoxed by some of the questions other words that you can use instead of flummoxed are bewildered puzzled or perplexed smart word number eight is rendezvous rendezvous rendezvous.,English
is a very french way of saying meeting or date for example i have a rendezvous with my friends over lunch on saturday or i'm planning to rendezvous with my friends at the mall for movies rendezvous can be used both as a noun or as a verb for example.,English
i have a rendezvous with my friends this evening or i'm going to rendezvous with my friends tomorrow.,English
in france earlier rendezvous was used by the army to indicate a meeting place for the troops now there's something slightly exciting and secretive about the word rendezvous even now so while you can use rendezvous for any meeting.,English
in general but it won't be very appropriate for an official meeting so if you have a date perhaps you can certainly call that a rendezvous smart word number 9 is obtuse obtuse obtuse is an insult you would use it when you're trying to call someone dumb or unintelligen.t or dim-witted now you've heard the word obtuse in geometry obtuse angle and acute angle so an obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.,English
and an acute angle is this sharp angle less than 90 degrees so acute as a word is used to denote sharp and therefore also mentally sharp and obtuse is denoting blunt and .therefore also a little slow in the mind so example sentences with obtuse are the man was so obtuse that he gave away his password to a fake caller or the obtuse child.,English
wasn't able.,English
to answer a single question on the test or the obtuse man had a hard time understanding even basic instructions now suppose in your situation in daily life your boyfriend or your girlfriend is angry with you and you don't know why so you can.,English
say to them maybe i'm being obtuse but i don't know why you're so upset smart word number 10 is sluggish sluggish sluggish means to move in  slow manner to be kind of slower paced.,English
than usual to look a bit tired and lacking.,English
in energy example a heavy lunch makes me very in the afternoon sluggish has roots from the word which means a slow person and a slug is an animal that moves around really very slowly like a snail examples.,English
the economy has been very sluggish this year or the match picked up after a sluggish start.,English
or business has been sluggish this quarter you can use it in your daily life if you're feeling very tired one day you can tell your mom or you can tell.,English
your friends i'm feeling very sluggish.,English
today i could do with a energy drink other words that you can use in place of sluggish could be lethargic or dragging my feet so those were the 10 smart words and before.,English
i give you that secret tip to sound very fluent i want to remind you that in.,English
case you're looking for smart words to use on a telephone call then i'm putting a link to a video.,English
down in the description box for that and now the secret tip the secret tip to sound fluent is to use not more than one smart word or sentence i know sometimes.,English
we get very excited because.,English
we've learnt a whole lot of these smart words and we tend to stuff two three four of them in one sentence that doesn't sound natural.,English
so one at a time be sure that you're pronouncing .the word in the right manner go on to google and type the word and in the search right on top you'll see a little speaker icon click on that speaker.,English
and hear the pronunciation once or twice.,English
and you're ready to go and if you've liked this video don't forget to give us a thumbs up with a comment.,English
for me under it telling me which of these 10 words what's your favorite and also.,English
if you haven't already press the subscribe button and the bell icon right next to it and happy watching.,English
hey guys welcome to my channel in this video.,English
i'm gonna give you top 50 english phrases that you can use in your everyday life.,English
so if you are just about to embark on your journey.,English
"to an english-speaking country, you can totally use this.",English
phrases if you have been learning english for a while and you want to resume learning.,English
this is the best video to start with so let's go 50 phrases in english in hopefully 10 minutes.,English
phrase number one this is another way to ask.,English
how are you?,English
how is it going?,English
how's it going?.,English
so you meet someone and you time how is it going?.,English
phrase number two when you haven't seen somebody for a while you tell him a long time no see so that means that you haven't seen this person maybe weeks or months a long time no see phrase number.,English
three if you want to ask you what have you been doing.,English
you ask what have you been up to so what was going on in your life?.,English
what have you been up to raise them before if everything is going?,English
well you can just answer can't complain everything is really cool.,English
"can't complain next phrase somebody tells you something and you haven't really mentioned it in the conversation like they guess somehow that you have a new job, and you ask him.",English
how do you know?.,English
where did you get the news like how do you.,English
know if somebody tells a cool joke you can tell that's a good one.,English
that's a great joke so the phrase is that's a good one.,English
if you want to thank somebody you can say it's very kind of you thank you so much for doing that that's very kind of you it is very kind of you if somebody.,English
"was trying to help you, but couldn't reach the result you can say.",English
"thank you anyway it doesn't matter, but thank you anyway.",English
thank you for your effort.,English
"no thank you anyway, and another phrase that i use in my email sometimes when i haven't asked for a person.",English
i ask and then i say in the end.,English
"thank you in advance, which means that i really hope that you're gonna.",English
do it some thanking you in advance.,English
"thank you in advance if somebody made a mistake, and he's really upset about it.",English
you can just say no worries.,English
"don't worry no worries, which means don't worry about it.",English
it's fine.,English
no worries imagine you came home and there are all of your friends sitting on your couch.,English
and you're like what's going on in here like what are you doing here?.,English
what is going on if you didn't catch something or it didn't understand the person you can always ask did i get you right?.,English
and then go ahead and explain where you got did i get you right?.,English
if you ask somebody not to be upset not to cry you can say don't take it to heart.,English
don't take it to heart like seriously don't be so upset don't take it to heart.,English
another way to ask if you didn't catch a part of a phrase you can say i didn't catch the last word.,English
i'm sorry.,English
can you repeat it because i didn't catch the last word if he wants somebody to repeat the whole phrase again.,English
you can say sorry.,English
i wasn't listening because maybe you were busy.,English
"maybe you were talking on the phone and somebody was talking to you, and you're like.",English
oh my god.,English
sorry i wasn't listening.,English
can you repeat it?.,English
i'm sorry.,English
i wasn't listening another phrase that i use all the time.,English
it doesn't matter like don't worry if you drop your coffee all over me.,English
it's like it doesn't matter.,English
i'll be fine.,English
i'm going to laundry anyway.,English
it doesn't matter if you want to wish somebody luck.,English
and i always do that you can say fingers crossed and you cross the fingers like that.,English
fingers crossed.,English
another phrase that americans use is oh bad that explains it and.,English
"the situation is you didn't get something and then you get an extra effect, and you get it.",English
and you're like oh that that explains it that explains it.,English
another way to tell the person to not be upset is you can say things happen like it's okay.,English
things happen do not be upset if you don't have the name of a person you want to talk to him.,English
you can say sorry to bother you you know you see.,English
somebody's busy you can always say sorry to bother you and then you can go ahead and ask.,English
"sorry to bother you.if you are in the middle of something in somebody's asking you something you can say oh.you're in the middle of something and somebody somebody's asking you to do something you say, i'm sorry.",English
i'll be with you in a minute i'll be with you in and then you resume doing something and you say where were we.,English
like when did we stop where were we and you have to repeat it because what it's the sound that somebody some people mistake with .,English
so this is a great way to practice where were we again if you're in the middle of a conversation?,English

 विकिसमाचार (मुक्त समाचार) योगदानकर्ताओं के लिए: यह लेख इंटरनेट (इण्टरनेट) विश्वकोश के बारे में बतलाता  है। कि विकिपीडिया के मुख्य पृष्ठ के लिए, विकिपीडिया का मुख्य पृष्ठ देखें। विकिपीडिया के आगंतुक परिचय के लिए, विकिपीडिया के बारे में पृष्ठ देखें। विकिपीडिया  एक मुफ्त,[5] वेब आधारित और सहयोगी बहुभाषी विश्वकोश है, जो गैर-लाभ विकिमीडिया फाउनडेशन से सहयोग प्राप्त परियोजना में उत्पन्न हुआ। इसका नाम दो शब्दों विकी (wiki) (यह सहयोगी वेबसाइटों के निर्माण की एक तकनीक है, यह एक हवाई शब्द विकी है जिसका अर्थ है ""जल्दी"") और एनसाइक्लोपीडिया (encyclopedia) का संयोजन है। 
दुनिया भर में स्वयंसेवकों के द्वारा सहयोग से विकिपीडिया के 1.3 करोड़ लेख (29 लाख अंग्रेजी विकिपीडिया में) लिखे गए हैं और इसके लगभग सभी लेखों को वह कोई भी व्यक्ति संपादित कर सकता है, जो विकिपीडिया वेबसाईट का उपयोग कर सकता है। [6] इसे जनवरी 2001 में जिम्मी वेल्स और लेरी सेंगर के द्वारा प्रारंभ (प्रारम्भ) किया गया,[7] यह वर्तमान में इंटरनेट (इण्टरनेट) पर सबसे लोकप्रिय संदर्भित कार्य है। 
[3][8][9][10] विकिपीडिया के आलोचक इसे व्यवस्थित पूर्वाग्रह और असंगतियों को दोषी ठहराते हैं,[11] और आरोप लगते हैं कि यह इसकी सम्पादकीय प्रक्रिया में उपलब्धियों पर सहमति का पक्ष लेती है।[12]
[13] विकिपीडिया की विश्वसनीयता और सटीकता भी एक मुद्दा है।[14][15] अन्य आलोचनाओं के अनुसार नकली या असत्यापित जानकारी का समावेश और विध्वंसक प्रवृति भी इसके दोष हैं,[16] हालाँकि विद्वानों के द्वारा किये गए कार्य बताते हैं कि विध्वंसक प्रवृति आमतौर पर अल्पकालिक होती है। 
[17][18] और एंड्रयू लिह ने ऑनलाइन पत्रकारिता पर पांचवीं अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय संगोष्ठी में,[19] विकिपीडिया के महत्त्व को न केवल एक विश्वकोश के सन्दर्भ में वर्णित किया बल्कि इसे एक बार बार अद्यतन होने वाले समाचार स्रोत के रूप में भी वर्णित किया क्योंकि यह हाल में हुई घटनाओं के बारे में बहुत जल्दी लेख प्रस्तुत करता है। जब टाइम पत्रिका ने यू (You) को वर्ष 2006 के लिए पर्सन ऑफ़ द इयर की मान्यता दी और बताया कि दुनिया भर में कई मिलियन उपयोगकर्ताओं के द्वारा इसका उपयोग किया जाता है और ऑनलाइन सहयोग में इसकी बढ़ती सफलता को मान्यता दी, इसने वेब 2.0 सेवाओ के तीन उदाहरणों में विकिपीडिया को यूट्यूब और माइस्पेस के साथ रखा। 
[20] विकिपीडिया, न्यूपीडिया (Nupedia) के लिए एक पूरक परियोजना के रूप में शुरू हुई, जो एक मुफ्त ऑनलाइन अंग्रेजी भाषा की विश्वकोश परियोजना है, जिसके लेखों को विशेषज्ञों के द्वारा लिखा गया और एक औपचारिक प्रक्रिया के तहत इसकी समीक्षा की गयी। न्यूपीडिया की स्थापना 9 मार्च 2000 को एक वेब पोर्टल कम्पनी बोमिस, इंक के स्वामित्व के तहत की गयी। इसके मुख्य सदस्य थे, जिम्मी वेल्स, बोमिस CEO और लेरी सेंगर, न्यूपीडिया के एडिटर-इन-चीफ और बाद के विकिपीडिया। 
प्रारंभ में न्यूपीडिया को इसके अपने न्यूपीडिया ओपन कंटेंट लाइसेंस के तहत लाइसेंस दिया गया और रिचर्ड स्टालमेन के सुझाव पर विकिपीडिया की स्थापना से पहले इसे GNU के मुफ्त डोक्युमेंटेशन लाइसेंस में बदल दिया गया। 
[21] लैरी सेंगर और जिम्मी वेल्स विकिपीडिया (Wikipedia) के संस्थापक हैं। [22][23] जहाँ एक ओर वेल्स को सार्वजनिक रूप से संपादन योग्य विश्वकोश के निर्माण के उद्देश्य को परिभाषित करने के श्रेय दिया जाता है,[24][25] सेंगर को आमतौर पर इस उद्देश्य को पूरा करने के लिए एक विकी की रणनीति का उपयोग करने का श्रेय दिया जाता है। [26] 10 जनवरी 2001 को, लेरी सेंगर ने न्यूपीडिया के लिए एक ""फीडर परियोजना"" के रूप में एक विकी का निर्माण करने के लिए न्यूपीडिया मेलिंग सूची की प्रस्तावना दी। 
[27]
विकिपीडिया को औपचारिक रूप से 15 जनवरी 2001 को, www.wikipedia.com पर एकमात्र अंग्रेजी भाषा के संस्करण के रूप में शुरू किया गया।[28] ओर इसकी घोषणा न्यूपीडिया मेलिंग सूची पर सेंगर के द्वारा की गयी। 
[24] विकिपीडिया की ""न्यूट्रल पॉइंट ऑफ़ व्यू""[29] की नीति को इसके प्रारंभिक महीनों में संकेतबद्ध किया गया, ओर यह न्यूपीडिया की प्रारंभिक ""पक्षपातहीन"" नीति के समान थी। 
अन्यथा, प्रारंभ में अपेक्षाकृत कम नियम थे और विकिपीडिया न्यूपीडिया से स्वतंत्र रूप से कार्य करती थी। [24] विकिपीडिया ने न्यूपीडिया से प्रारंभिक योगदानकर्ता प्राप्त किये, ये थे स्लेशडॉट पोस्टिंग और सर्च इंजन इंडेक्सिंग। 
2001 के अंत तक इसके लगभग 20,000 लेख और 18 भाषाओँ के संस्करण हो चुके थे। 2002 के अंत तक इसके 26 भाषाओँ के संस्करण हो गए, 2003 के अंत तक 46 और 2004 के अंतिम दिनों तक 161 भाषाओँ के संस्करण हो गए।[30] न्यूपीडिया और विकिपीडिया तब तक एक साथ उपस्थित थे जब पहले वाले के सर्वर को स्थायी रूप से 2003 में डाउन कर दिया गया और इसके पाठ्य को विकिपीडिया में डाल दिया गया। 
9 सितम्बर 2007 को अंग्रेजी विकिपीडिया 2 मिलियन लेख की संख्या को पार कर गया, यह तब तक का सबसे बड़ा संकलित विश्वकोश बन गया, यहाँ तक कि इसने योंगल विश्वकोश के रिकॉर्ड (1407) को भी तोड़ दिया, जिसने 600 वर्षों के लिए कायम रखा था। 
[31] एक कथित अंग्रेजी केन्द्रित विकिपीडिया में नियंत्रण की कमी और वाणिज्यिक विज्ञापन की आशंका से, स्पेनिश विकिपीडिया के उपयोगकर्ता फरवरी 2002 में Enciclopedia Libre के निर्माण के लिए विकिपीडिया से अलग हो गए।[32] बाद में उसी वर्ष, वेल्स ने घोषित किया कि विकिपीडिया विज्ञापनों का प्रदर्शन नहीं करेगा और इसकी वेबसाईट को wikipedia.org में स्थानांतरित कर दिया गया। [33] तब से कई अन्य परियोजनाओं को सम्पादकीय कारणों से विकिपीडिया से अलग किया गया है। विकिइन्फो के लिए किसी उदासीन दृष्टिकोण की आवश्यकता नहीं होती है और यह मूल अनुसंधान की अनुमति देता है। विकिपीडिया से प्रेरित नयी परियोजनाएं-जैसे सिटीजेंडियम (Citizendium), स्कॉलरपीडिया (Scholarpedia), कंजर्वापीडिया (Conservapedia) और गूगल्स नोल (Knol)[कृपया उद्धरण जोड़ें]-विकिपीडिया की कथित सीमाओं को संबोधित करने के लिए शुरू की गयी हैं, जैसे सहकर्मी समीक्षा, मूल अनुसंधान और वाणिज्यिक विज्ञापनपर इसकी नीतियां। विकिपीडिया फाउंडेशन का निर्माण 20 जून 2003 को विकिपीडिया और न्यूपीडिया से किया गया। [34] इसे 17 सितम्बर 2004 को विकिपीडिया को ट्रेडमार्क करने के लिए ट्रेडमार्क कार्यालय और अमेरिकी पेटेंट पर लागू किया गया। 
इस मार्क को 10 जनवरी 2006 को पंजीकरण का दर्जा दिया गया। 16 दिसम्बर 2004 को जापान के द्वारा ट्रेडमार्क संरक्षण उपलब्ध कराया गया और 20 जनवरी 2005 को यूरोपीय संघ के द्वारा ट्रेडमार्क संरक्षण उपलब्ध कराया गया। तकनीकी रूप से एक सर्विस मार्क, मार्क का स्कोप ""इंटरनेट के माध्यम से आम विश्वकोश के ज्ञान के क्षेत्र में जानकारी के प्रावधान"" के लिए है,[कृपया उद्धरण जोड़ें] कुछ उत्पादों जैसे पुस्तकों और DVDs के लिए विकिपीडिया ट्रेडमार्क के उपयोग को लाइसेंस देने की योजनायें बनायी जा रही हैं।

पारंपरिक विश्वकोशों जैसे एन्साइक्लोपीडिया ब्रिटेनिका (Encyclopædia Britannica) के विपरीत, विकिपीडिया के लेख किसी औपचारिक सहकर्मी समीक्षा की प्रक्रिया से होकर नहीं गुजरते हैं और लेख में परिवर्तन तुंरत उपलब्ध हो जाते हैं l
किसी भी लेख पर इसके निर्माता या किसी अन्य संपादक का अधिकार नहीं है और न ही किसी मान्यता प्राप्त प्राधिकरण के द्वारा इसका निरीक्षण किया जा सकता है। कुछ ही ऐसे विध्वंस-प्रवण पेज हैं जिन्हें केवल इनके स्थापित उपयोगकर्ताओं के द्वारा ही संपादित किया जा सकता है, या विशेष मामलों में केवल प्रशासकों के द्वारा संपादित किया जा सकता है, हर लेख को गुमनाम रूप में या एक उपयोगकर्ता के अकाउंट के साथ संपादित किया जा सकता है, जबकि केवल पंजीकृत उपयोगकर्ता ही एक नया लेख बना सकते हैं (केवल अंग्रेजी संस्करण में)।
इसके परिणामस्वरूप, विकिपीडिया अपने अवयवों ""की वैद्यता की कोई गारंटी नहीं"" देता है। 
[36] एक सामान्य सन्दर्भ कार्य होने के कारण, विकिपीडिया में कुछ ऐसी सामग्री भी है जिसे विकिपीडिया के संपादकों सहित कुछ लोग[37] आक्रामक, आपत्तिजनक और अश्लील मानते हैं। [38] उदाहरण के लिए, 2008 में, विकिपीडिया, ने इस निति को ध्यान में रखते हुए, अपने अंग्रेजी संस्करण में, मुहम्मद के वर्णन को शामिल करने के खिलाफ एक एक ऑनलाइन याचिका को अस्वीकार कर दिया।
विकिपीडिया में राजनीतिक रूप से संवेदनशील सामग्री की उपस्थिति के कारण, पीपुल्स रिपब्लिक ऑफ चाइना ने इस वेबसाइट के कुछ भागों का उपयोग को प्रतिबंधित कर दिया।[39] (यह भी देखें: विकिपीडिया के IWF ब्लॉक) विकिपीडिया के अवयव फ्लोरिडा में कानून के अधीन हैं (विशेष कॉपीराईट कानून में), जहाँ विकिपीडिया के सर्वरों की मेजबानी की जाती है और कई सम्पादकीय नीतियां और दिशानिर्देश इस बात पर बल देते हैं कि विकिपीडिया एक विश्वकोश है। 
विकिपीडिया में प्रत्येक प्रविष्टि एक विषय के बारे में होनी चाहिए जो विश्वकोश से सम्बंधित है और इस प्रकार से शामिल किये जाने के योग्य है। एक विषय विश्वकोश से सम्बंधित समझा जा सकता है यदि यह विकिपीडिया के शब्दजाल में ""उल्लेखनीय"" है,[40] अर्थात, यदि इसने उन माध्यमिक विश्वसनीय स्रोतों में महत्वपूर्ण कवरेज़ प्राप्त किया है (अर्थात मुख्यधारा मीडिया या मुख्य अकादमिक जर्नल), जो इस विषय के मामले से स्वतंत्र हैं। दूसरा, विकिपीडिया को केवल उसी ज्ञान को प्रदर्शित करना है जो पहले से ही स्थापित और मान्यता प्राप्त है।[41] दूसरे शब्दों में, उदाहरण के लिए इसे नयी जानकारी और मूल कार्य को प्रस्तुत नहीं करना चाहिए। एक दावा जिसे चुनौती दी जा सकती है, उसे विश्वसनीय सूत्रों के सन्दर्भ की आवश्यकता होती है। विकिपीडिया समुदाय के भीतर, इसे अक्सर ""verifiability, not truth"" के रूप में बताया जाता है, यह इस विचार को व्यक्त करता है कि पाठक खुद लेख में प्रस्तुत होने वाली सामग्री की सच्चाई की जांच कर सकें और इस विषय में अपनी खुद की व्याख्या बनायें.",Hindi
"[42] अंत में, विकिपीडिया एक पक्ष नहीं लेता है।[43] सभी विचार और दृष्टिकोण, यदि बाहरी स्रोतों को निर्दिष्ट कर सकते हैं, उन्हें एक लेख के भीतर कवरेज़ का उपयुक्त हिस्सा मिलना चाहिए। [44] विकिपीडिया के संपादक एक समुदाय के रूप में उन नीतियों और दिशानिर्देशों को लिखते हैं और संशोधित करते हैं,[45] और उन्हें डिलीट करके उन पर बल देते हैं, टैग लगा कर उनकी व्याख्या करते हैं, या लेख की उस सामग्री में संशोधन करते हैं जो उसकी जरूरतों को पूरा करने में असफल होती हैं। 
(डीलीट करना और शामिल करना भी देखें)[46][47] योगदानकर्ता, चाहे वे पंजीकृत हों या नहीं, सॉफ्टवेयर में उपलब्ध उन सुविधाओं का लाभ उठा सकते हैं, जो विकिपीडिया को प्रबल बनाती हैं। 
प्रत्येक लेख से जुड़ा ""इतिहास"" का पृष्ठ लेख के प्रत्येक पिछले दोहरान का रिकॉर्ड रखता है, हालाँकि अभियोगपत्र के अवयवों, आपराधिक धमकी या कॉपीराइट के उल्लंघन के दोहरान को बाद में हटाया जा सकता है।
[48][49] यह सुविधा पुराने और नए संस्करणों की तुलना को आसान बनाती है, उन परिवर्तनों को अन्डू करने में मदद करती है जो संपादक को अनावश्यक लगते हैं, या खोये हुए अवयवों को रीस्टोर करने में भी मदद करती है। प्रत्येक लेख से सम्बंधित ""डिस्कशन (चर्चा)"" के पृष्ठ कई संपादकों के बीच कार्य का समन्वय करने के लिए प्रयुक्त किये जाते हैं।
[50] नियमित योगदानकर्ता अक्सर, अपनी रूचि के लेखों की एक ""वॉचलिस्ट"" बना कर रखते हैं, ताकि वे उन लेखों में हाल ही में हुए सभी परिवर्तनों पर आसानी से टैब्स रख सकें.",Hindi
"बोट्स नामक कंप्यूटर प्रोग्राम के निर्माण के बाद से ही इसका प्रयोग व्यापक रूप से विध्वंस प्रवृति को हटाने के लिए किया जाता रहा है,[18] इसका प्रयोग गलत वर्तनी और शैलीगत मुद्दों को सही करने के लिए और सांख्यिकीय आंकडों से मानक प्रारूप में भूगोल की प्रविष्टियों जैसे लेख को शुरू करने के लिए किया जाता है। संपादन मॉडल का खुला स्वभाव विकिपीडिया के अधिकांश आलोचकों के लिए केंद्र बना रहा है। 
उदाहरण के लिए, किसी भी अवसर पर, एक लेख का पाठक यह सुनिश्चित नहीं कर सकता कि जिस लेख को वह पढ़ रहा है उसमें विध्वंस प्रवृति शामिल है या नहीं। आलोचक तर्क देते हैं कि गैर विशेषज्ञ सम्पादन गुणवत्ता को कम कर देता है। क्योंकि योगदानकर्ता आम तौर पर पूरे दोहरान के बजाय एक प्रविष्टि के छोटे हिस्से को पुनः लिखते हैं, एक प्रविष्टि में उच्च और निम्न गुणवत्ता के अवयव परस्पर मिश्रित हो सकते हैं। 
इतिहासकार रॉय रोजेनजवीग ने कहा: ""कुल मिलाकर, लेखन विकिपीडिया का कमजोर आधार है। समितियां कभी कभी अच्छा लिखती हैं और विकिपीडिया की प्रविष्टियों की गुणवत्ता अक्सर अस्थिर होती है जो भिन्न लोगों के द्वारा लिखे गए वाक्यों या प्रकरणों के परस्पर मिलने का परिणाम होती हैं। ""
[51] ये सभी सटीक सूचना के एक स्रोत के रूप में विकिपीडिया की विश्वसनीयता पर सवाल पैदा करते हैं। 2008 में, दो शोधकर्ताओं ने सिद्धांत दिया कि विकिपीडिया का विकास सतत है।
[52] विकिपीडिया पर व्यवस्थित पूर्वाग्रह और असंगति प्रदर्शित करने का आरोप लगाया गया है;[15] आलोचकों का तर्क है कि अधिकांश जानकारी के लिए उपयुक्त स्रोतों की कमी और विकिपीडिया का खुला स्वभाव इसे अविश्वसनीय बनाता है। 
[53] कुछ टिप्पणीकारों का सुझाव है कि विकिपीडिया आमतौर पर विश्वसनीय है, लेकिन किसी भी दिए गए लेख की विश्वसनीयता हमेशा स्पष्ट नहीं होती है।[13] पारंपरिक सन्दर्भ कार्य जैसे एन्साइक्लोपीडिया ब्रिटेनिका (Encyclopædia Britannica) के सम्पादक, एक विश्वकोश के रूप में परियोजना की उपयोगिता और प्रतिष्ठा पर सवाल उठाते हैं। [54] विश्वविद्यालयों के कई प्रवक्ता अकादमिक कार्य में किसी भी एनसाइक्लोपीडिया, का प्राथमिक स्रोत के रूप में उपयोग करने से छात्रों को हतोत्साहित करते हैं;[55] कुछ तो विशेष रूप से विकिपीडिया के उपयोग को निषिद्ध करते हैं।[56] सह संस्थापक जिमी वेल्स इस बात पर ज़ोर देते है कि किसी भी प्रकार का विश्वकोश आमतौर पर प्राथमिक स्रोत के रूप में उपयुक्त नहीं हैं और प्राधिकृत के रूप से इस पर भरोसा नहीं किया जाना चाहिए।[57] उपयोगकर्ताओं की गोपनीयता के परिणामस्वरूप लेखे-जोखे की क्षमता की कमी के सम्बन्ध में भी मुद्दे उठाये गए हैं,[58] साथ ही कृत्रिम सूचना की प्रविष्टि, विध्वंस प्रवृति और इसी तरह की अन्य समस्याएं भी सामने आयी हैं।
विशेष रूप से एक घटना, जिसका बहुत प्रचार हुआ, में अमेरिकी राजनीतिज्ञ जॉन सीजेनथेलर की जीवनी के बारे में गलत जानकारी डाल दी गयी और चार महीने तक इसका पता नहीं लगाया जा सका।
[59]USA टुडे के फाउन्डिंग एडिटोरिअल डायरेक्टर और वेंडरबिल्ट विश्वविद्यालय में फ्रीडम फोरम फर्स्ट अमेरिकन सेंटर के संस्थापक जॉन सीजेनथेलर ने जिमी वेल्स को बुलाया और उससे पूछा, ""....
क्या आप.............जानते हैं कि यह किसने लिखा है?",Hindi
"""""नहीं, हम नहीं जानते"", जिमी ने कहा.",Hindi
"[60] कुछ आलोचकों का दावा है कि विकिपीडिया की खुली सरंचना के कारण इंटरनेट उत्पीड़क, विज्ञापनदाता और वे लोग जो कोई हमला बोलना चाहते हैं, इसे आसानी से लक्ष्य बनाते हैं।[48][61]अमेरिकी प्रतिनिधि सभा और विशेष हित के समूहों सहित संगठनों के द्वारा दिए गए लेखों में राजनितिक परिप्रेक्ष्य[16] शामिल किया गया है,[62] और संगठन जैसे माइक्रोसोफ्ट ने विशेष लेखों पर काम करने के लिए वित्तीय भत्ते देने का प्रस्ताव रखा है।[63] इन मुद्दों को मुख्य रूप से कोलबर्ट रिपोर्ट में स्टीफन कोलबर्ट के द्वारा ख़राब तरीके से प्रस्तुत किया गया है। [64] 2009 की पुस्तक द विकिपीडिया रेवोलुशन के लेखक एंड्रयू लिह के अनुसार, ""एक विकी में इसकी सभी गतिविधियाँ खुले में होती हैं ताकि इनकी जांच की जा सके...... समुदाय में अन्य लोगों की क्रियाओं के प्रेक्षण के द्वारा भरोसा पैदा किया जाता है, इसके लिए लोगों की सामान और पूरक रुचियों का पता लगाया जाता है।"" [65] अर्थशास्त्री टायलर कोवेन लिखते हैं, ""यदि मुझे यह सोचना पड़े कि अर्थशास्त्र पर विकिपीडिया के जर्नल लेख सच हैं या या मीडियन सम्बन्धी लेख सच हैं, तो मैं विकिपीडिया को चुनूंगा, इसके लिए मुझे ज्यादा सोचना नहीं पडेगा.""",Hindi
"वह टिप्पणी देते हैं कि नॉन-फिक्शन के कई पारंपरिक स्रोत प्रणालीगत पूर्वाग्रहों से पीड़ित है। जर्नल लेख में नवीन परिणामों की रिपोर्ट जरुरत से जयादा दी जाती है और प्रासंगिक जानकारी को समाचार रिपोर्ट में से हटा दिया जाता है।
हालाँकि, वे यह चेतावनी भी देते हैं कि इंटरनेट की साइटों पर त्रुटियां अक्सर पायी जाती हैं और शिक्षाविदों तथा विशेषज्ञों को इन्हें सुधारने के लिए सतर्क रहना चाहिए, 
[66] फ़रवरी 2007 में, द हार्वर्ड क्रिमसन अखबार में एक लेख में कहा गया कि हार्वर्ड विश्वविद्यालय में कुछ प्रोफेसर अपने पाठ्यक्रम में विकिपीडिया को शामिल करते हैं, लेकिन विकिपीडिया का उपयोग करने में उनकी अवधारणा में मतभेद है। 
[67] जून 2007 में अमेरिकी लाइब्रेरी एसोसिएशन के भूतपूर्व अध्यक्ष माइकल गोर्मनने गूगल के साथ, विकिपीडिया को निंदन किया,[68] और कहा कि वे शिक्षाविद जो विकिपीडिया के उपयोग का समर्थन करते हैं ""बौद्धिक रूप से उस आहार विशेषज्ञ के समतुल्य हैं जो सब चीजों के साथ बिग मैक्स के निरंतर आहार की सलाह देते हैं।"" उन्होंने यह भी कहा कि ""बौद्धिक रूप से निष्क्रिय लोगों की एक पीढ़ी जो इन्टरनेट से आगे बढ़ने में असमर्थ है"", उसे विश्वविद्यालयों में उत्पन्न किया जा रहा है। उनकी शिकायत है कि वेब आधारित स्रोत उस अधिक दुर्लभ पाठ्य को सीखने से रोक रहे हैं जो या तो केवल दस्तावेजों में मिलता है या सबस्क्रिप्शन-ओनली (जिनमें सदस्यता ली जाती है) वेबसाइट्स पर मिलता है। 
इसी लेख में जेन्नी फ्राई (ऑक्सफ़ोर्ड इंटरनेट संस्थान में एक अनुसंधान साथी) ने विकिपीडिया की अकादमिक शिक्षा पर टिप्पणी दी कि: ""आप यह नहीं कह सकते हैं कि बच्चे बौद्धिक रूप से आलसी हैं क्योंकि वे इंटरनेट का उपयोग कर रहें हैं जबकि दूसरी ओर शिक्षाविद अपने अनुसंधान में सर्च इंजन का उपयोग कर रहे हैं। 
अंतर यह है कि उन्हें जो भी उन्हें प्राप्त हो रहा है, वह अधिकारिक है या नहीं और इसके बारे में जटिल होने का उन्हें अधिक अनुभव है। बच्चों को यह बताने की आवश्यकता है कि एक महत्वपूर्ण और उचित तरीके से इंटरनेट का उपयोग कैसे किया जाये। ""[68] विकिपीडिया समुदाय ने विकिपीडिया की विश्वसनीयता को सुधारने की कोशिश की है। अंग्रेजी भाषा के विकिपीडिया ने मूल्यांकन पैमाने की शुरुआत की जिससे लेख की गुणवत्ता की जांच की जाती है;[69] अन्य संस्करणों ने भी इसे अपना लिया है। अंग्रजी में लगभग 2500 लेख ""फीचर्ड आर्टिकल"" के दर्जे के उच्चतम रैंक तक पहुँचने के लिए मापदंडों के समुच्चय को पास कर चुके हैं;[70] ऐसे लेख अपने विषय में सम्पूर्ण और भली प्रकार से लिखा गया कवरेज़ उपलब्ध कराते हैं, जिन्हें कई सहकर्मी समीक्षा प्रकाशनों के द्वारा समर्थन प्राप्त है।[71] ज़र्मन विकिपीडिया, लेखों के ""स्थिर संस्करणों"" के रख रखाव की एक प्रणाली का परीक्षण कर रहा है,[72] ताकि यह एक पाठक को लेख के उन संस्करणों को देखने में मदद करे जो विशिष्ट समीक्षाओं से होकर गुजर चुके हैं। अन्य भाषाओँ के संस्करण इस ""ध्वजांकित संशोधन"" के प्रस्ताव को लागू करने के लिए एक सहमति तक नहीं पहुँचे हैं।[73][74] एक और प्रस्ताव यह है कि व्यक्तिगत विकिपीडिया योगदानकर्ताओं के लिए ""ट्रस्ट रेटिंग"" बनाने के लिए सॉफ्टवेयर का उपयोग और इन रेटिंग्स का उपयोग यह निर्धारित करने में करना कि कौन से परिवर्तन तुंरत दिखायी देंगे। 
[75] विकिपीडिया समुदाय ने ""a bureaucracy of sorts"" की स्थापना की है, जिसमें ""एक स्पष्ट सत्ता सरंचना शामिल है जो स्वयं सेवी प्रशासकों को सम्पादकीय नियंत्रण का अधिकार देती है। [76][77][78]
विकिपीडिया के समुदाय को ""पंथ की तरह (cult-like)"" के रूप में भी वर्णित किया गया है,[79] हालाँकि इसे हमेशा पूरी तरह से नकारात्मक अभिधान के साथ इस तरह से वर्णित नहीं किया गया है,[80] और अनुभवहीन उपयोगकर्ताओं को समायोजित करने की असफलता के लिए इसकी आलोचना की जाती है।[81] समुदाय में अच्छी प्रतिष्ठा के सम्पादक स्वयंसेवक स्टेवर्डशिप के कई स्तरों में से एक को चला सकते हैं; यह ""प्रशासक"" के साथ शुरू होता है,[82][83] विशेषाधिकृत उपयोगकर्ताओं का एक समूह जिसके पास पृष्ठों को डीलीट करने की क्षमता है, विध्वंस प्रवृति या सम्पादकीय विवादों की स्थिति में लेख में परिवर्तन को रोक (lock) देते हैं और उपयोगकर्ताओं के सम्पादन को अवरुद्ध कर देते हैं। 
नाम के अलावा, प्रशासक फैसला लेने में किसी भी विशेषाधिकार का उपयोग नहीं करते हैं; इसके बजाय वे अधिकतर उन लेखों के संपादन तक ही सीमित होते हैं, जिनमें परियोजना व्यापक प्रभाव होते हैं और इस प्रकार से ये सामान्य संपादकों को अनुमति नहीं देते हैं और उपयोगकर्ताओं को विघटनकारी संपादन (जैसे विध्वंस प्रवृति) के लिए प्रतिबंधित कर देते हैं। 
[84] चूंकि विकिपीडिया विश्वकोश निर्माण के अपरंपरागत मोडल के साथ विकसित होता है, ""विकिपीडिया को कौन लिखता है?""",Hindi
"यह परियोजना के बारे में बार बार, अक्सर अन्य वेब 2.0 परियोजनाओं जैसे डिग के सन्दर्भ में पूछे जाने वाले प्रश्नों में से एक बन गया है। 
[85] जिमी वेल्स ने एक बार तर्क किया कि केवल ""एक समुदाय... कुछ सौ स्वयंसेवकों का एक समर्पित समूह"" विकिपीडिया को बहुत अधिक योगदान देता है और इसलिए परियोजना ""किसी पारंपरिक संगठन से अधिक मिलती जुलती है"" 
वेल्स ने एक अध्ययन में पाया कि 50% से अधिक संपादन केवल .7% उपयोगकर्ताओं के द्वारा ही किये जाते हैं, (उस समय पर: 524 लोग) योगदान के मूल्यांकन की इस विधि पर बाद में आरोन सवार्त्ज़ ने विवाद उठाया उन्होंने नोट किया कि कई लेख जिन पर उन्होंने अध्ययन किया, उनके अवयवों के एक बड़े भाग में उपयोगकर्ताओं ने कम सम्पादन के साथ योगदान दिया था। 
[86] 2007 में डार्टमाउथ कॉलेज के शोधकर्ताओं ने अध्ययन में यह पाया कि ""विकिपीडिया के गुमनाम और विरले योगदानकर्ता.........ज्ञान के स्रोत के रूप में उतने ही विश्वसनीय हैं, जितने कि वे योगदानकर्ता जो साईट के साथ पंजीकरण करते हैं।"" 
[87]
हालाँकि कुछ योगदानकर्ता अपने क्षेत्र में प्राधिकारी हैं, विकिपीडिया के लिए यह आवश्यक है कि यहाँ तक कि उनके योगदानकर्ता को प्रकाशित और निरीक्षण के सूत्रों द्वारा समर्थन प्राप्त हो। परियोजना की योग्यता पर सहमति की प्राथमिकता को ""उत्कृष्ट-विरोधी"" के रूप में चिन्हित किया गया है।[11] अगस्त 2007 में, विर्गील ग्रिफ़िथ द्वारा विकसित एक वेबसाईट विकिस्केनर ने विकिपीडिया के खातों के बिना बेनाम संपादकों के द्वारा विकिपीडिया में किये जाने वाले परिवर्तन के स्रोतों का पता लगाना शुरू किया। 
इस कार्यक्रम ने प्रकट किया कि कई ऐसे संपादन निगमों या सरकारी एजेंसियों के द्वारा किये गए जिनमें उन से सम्बंधित, उनके कर्मचारियों या उनके कार्यों से सम्बंधित लेखों के अवयवों को बदला गया।[88] 2003 में एक समुदाय के रूप में विकिपीडिया के एक अध्ययन में, अर्थशास्त्र के पी.एच.डी.",Hindi
"विद्यार्थी आंद्रे सिफोलिली ने तर्क दिया कि विकी सॉफ्टवेयर में भाग लेने की कम लेन देन लागत सहयोगी विकास के लिए एक उत्प्रेरक का काम करती है और यह कि एक ""निर्माणात्मक रचना"" दृष्टिकोण भागीदारी को प्रोत्साहित करता है। 
[89] ओक्स्फोर्ड इंटरनेट संस्थान और हार्वर्ड लॉ स्कूल्स बर्क्मेन सेंटर फॉर इंटरनेट एंड सोसाइटी के जोनाथन जीटरेन ने अपनी 2008 की पुस्तक द फ्यूचर ऑफ़ द इन्टरनेट एंड हाउ टु स्टाप इट में कहा कैसे खुले सहयोग में एक केस अध्ययन के रूप में विकिपीडिया की सफलता ने वेब में नवाचार को बढ़ावा दिया है।

जनवरी 2002 (द्वितीय चरण) में शुरू होकर, विकिपीडिया ने MySQL डेटाबेस के साथ एक PHP विकी इंजन पर चलना शुरू कर दिया; यह सॉफ्टवेयर माग्नस मांसके के द्वारा विकिपीडिया के लिए कस्टम-निर्मित था। 
दूसरे चरण के सॉफ्टवेयर को तीव्र गति से बढ़ती मांग को समायोजित करने के लिए बार बार संशोधित किया गया। जुलाई 2002 (तीसरे चरण) में, विकिपीडिया तीसरी पीढ़ी के सॉफ्टवेयर में स्थानांतरित हो गया, यह मिडिया विकी था जिसे मूल रूप से ली डेनियल क्रोकर के द्वारा लिखा गया था। [97] मीड़याविकी सॉफ्टवेयर की कार्यक्षमता बढ़ाने के लिए कई मीड़याविकी विस्तार इन्सटाल किये गए हैं। 
अप्रैल 2005 में एक ल्युसेन विस्तार[98][99] को मिडिया विकी के बिल्ट-इन सर्च में जोड़ा गया और विकिपीडिया सर्चिंग के लिए MySQL से ल्युसेन में बदल गया। 
वर्तमान में ल्युसेन सर्च 2,[100] जो कि जावा में लिखी गयी है और ल्युसेन लायब्रेरी 2.0 पर आधारित है,[101] का प्रयोग किया जाता है। विकिपीडिया वर्तमान में लिनक्स सर्वर (मुख्य रूप से उबुन्टु), के समर्पित समूहों पर,[102][103] ज़ेड एफ़ एस के लिए कुछ ओपनसोलारिस मशीनों के साथ संचालित है। 
फरवरी 2008 में, फ्लोरिडा में 300, एम्स्टरडाम में 26 और 23 याहू!",Hindi
"के कोरियाई होस्टिंग सुविधा सियोल में थीं।[104] 2004 तक विकिपीडिया ने एकमात्र सर्वर का प्रयोग किया, इसके बाद सर्वर प्रणाली को एक वितरित बहुस्तरीय वास्तुकला में विस्तृत किया गया। जनवरी 2005 में, यह परियोजना, फ्लोरिडा में स्थित 39 समर्पित सर्वरों पर संचालित थी। इस विन्यास में MySQL चलाने वाला एकमात्र मास्टर डेटाबेस सर्वर, मल्टिपल स्लेव डेटाबेस सर्वर, अपाचे HTTP सर्वर को चलने वाले 21 वेब सर्वर और सात स्क्वीड केचे सर्वर शामिल हैं। विकिपीडिया दिन के समय के आधार पर प्रति सेकंड 25,000 और 60,000 के बीच पृष्ठ अनुरोधों को प्राप्त करता है। [105] पृष्ठ अनुरोधों को पहले स्क्वीड कैचिंग सर्वर की सामने के अंत की परत को पास किया जाता है।
[106] जिन अनुरोधों को स्क्वीड केचे से सर्व नहीं किया जा सकता है, उन्हें लिनक्स वर्चुअल सर्वर सॉफ्टवेयर चलाने वाले लोड-बेलेंसिंग सर्वरों को भेज दिया जाता है, जो बदले में डेटाबेस से पृष्ठ प्रतिपादन के लिए अपाचे वेब सर्वरों में से एक को यह अनुरोध भेज देता है। 
वेब सर्वर अनुरोध के अनुसार पृष्ठों की डिलीवरी करता है और विकिपीडिया के सभी भाषाओँ के संस्करणों के लिए पृष्ठ प्रतिपादन करता है। गति को और बढ़ाने के लिए, प्रतिपादित पृष्ठों को एक वितरित स्मृति केचे में अमान्य करने तक रखा जाता है, जिससे अधिकांश आम पृष्ठों के उपयोग के लिए पृष्ठ प्रतिपादन पूरी तरह से चूक जाता है। नीदरलैंड और कोरिया में दो बड़े समूह अब विकिपीडिया के अधिकांश ट्रेफिक लोड को संभालते हैं। विकिपीडिया में सभी पाठ्य GNU फ्री डोक्युमेंटेशन लाइसेंस (GFDL) के द्वारा कवर किया गया, यह एक कॉपीलेफ्ट लाइसेंस है जो पुनर्वितरण, व्युत्पन्न कार्यों के निर्माण और अवयवों के वाणिज्यिक उपयोग की अनुमति देता है, जबकि लेखक अपने कार्य के कॉपीराइट को बनाये रखते हैं,[107] जून 2009 तक, जब साईट क्रिएटिव कोमन्स एटरीब्यूशन-शेयर अलाइक (CC-by-SA) 3.0 को स्थानांतरित हो गयी। 
[108] विकिपीडिया क्रिएटिव कॉमन्स लाईसेन्स की ओर स्थानान्तरण पर कार्य करती रही है, क्योंकि जो GFDL प्रारंभ में सॉफ्टवेयर मेनवल के लिए डिजाइन की गयी, वह ऑनलाइन सन्दर्भ कार्यों के लिए उपयुक्त नहीं है, ओर क्योंकि दोनों लाइसेंस असंगत थे। 
[109] नवम्बर 2008 में विकिमीडिया फाउंडेशन के अनुरोध की प्रतिक्रिया में, फ्री सॉफ्टवेयर फाउंडेशन (FSF) ने GFDL के नए संस्करण को जारी किया, जिसे विशेष रूप से 1 अगस्त 2009 को relicense its content to CC-BY-SA के लिए विकिपीडिया को समायोजित करने के लिए डिजाइन किया गया था। 
विकिपीडिया ओर इसकी सम्बन्धी परियोजनाओं ने एक समुदाय व्यापक जनमत संग्रह का आयोजन किया ताकि यह फैसला लिया जा सके कि इस लाइसेंस को बदला जाना चाहिए या नहीं। 
[110] यह जनमत संग्रह 9 अप्रैल से 30 अप्रैल तक किया गया।[111] परिणाम थे 75.8% ""हाँ"", 10.5% ""नहीं"" और 13.7% ""कोई राय नहीं""[112] इस जनमत संग्रह के परिणाम में, विकिमीडिया न्यासी मंडल ने क्रिएटिव कॉमन्स लाईसेन्स को, प्रभावी 15 जून 2009 से बदलने के लिए मतदान किया।[112] यह स्थिति कि विकिपीडिया सिर्फ एक मेजबान सेवा है, इसका उपयोग सफलतापूर्वक अदालत में एक बचाव के रूप में किया गया है।[113][114] मीडिया फ़ाइलों (उदाहरण छवि फ़ाइलें) की हेंडलिंग का तरीका भाषा संस्करण के अनुसार अलग अलग होता है। कुछ भाषा संस्करण जैसे अंग्रेजी विकिपीडिया में उचित उपयोग सिद्धांत के अर्न्तगत गैर मुफ्त छवि फाइलें शामिल हैं जबकि अन्य में ऐसा नहीं होता है। यह भिन्न देशों के बीच कॉपीराइट कानूनों में अंतर के कारण आंशिक है; उदाहरण के लिए, उचित उपयोग की धारणा जापानी कॉपीराइट कानून में मौजूद नहीं है। मुफ्त सामग्री लाइसेंस के द्वारा कवर की जाने वाली मिडिया फाइलें, (उदाहरण क्रिएटिव कोमन्स cc-by-sa) को विकिमीडिया कोमन्स रिपोजिटरी के माध्यम से भाषा संस्करणों में शेयर किया जाता है, यह विकिमीडिया फाउंडेशन द्वारा संचालित परियोजना है। वर्तमान में विकिपीडिया के 262 भाषा संस्करण हैं; इनमें से 24 भाषाओं में 100,000 से अधिक लेख है और 81 भाषाओं में 1,000 से अधिक लेख है।[1] एलेक्सा के अनुसार, अंग्रेजी उपडोमेन (en.wikipedia.org; अंग्रेजी विकिपीडिया) अन्य भाषाओँ में शेष विभाजन के साथ विकिपीडिया के कुल ट्रेफिक का 52% भाग प्राप्त करता है (स्पेनिश: 19%, फ्रेंच: 5%, पॉलिश: 3%, जर्मन: 3%, जापानी: 3%, पुर्तगाली: 2%).",Hindi
"[3] जुलाई 2008 को, पांच सबसे बड़े भाषा संस्करण हैं (लेख गणना के क्रम में)- अंग्रेजी, जर्मन, फ्रेंच, पॉलिश और जापानी विकिपीडिया.",Hindi
"[115] चूंकि विकिपीडिया वेब आधारित है और इसलिए पूरी दुनिया में समान भाषा संस्करण के योगदानकर्ता भिन्न बोलियों का प्रयोग कर सकते हैं या भिन्न देशों से आ सकते हैं (जैसा कि अंग्रेजी संस्करण के मामले में होता है) 
इन अंतरों के कारण वर्तनी अंतर (जैसे रंग बनाम रंग)[116] या दृष्टिकोण पर कुछ मतभेद हो सकते हैं। 
[117]
हालाँकि वैश्विक नीतियों जैसे ""न्यूट्रल पॉइंट ऑफ़ व्यू"" के लिए कई भाषाओँ के संस्करण हैं, वे नीति और अभ्यास के कुछ बिन्दुओं पर वितरित हो जाते हैं, सबसे विशेषकर उन छवियों पर जिन्हें मुफ्त लाइसेंस प्राप्त नहीं हुआ है, उनका उपयोग उचित उपयोग के एक दावे के अर्न्तगत किया जा सकता है। 
[118][119][120] जिमी वेल्स ने विकिपीडिया को इस प्रकार से वर्णित किया है, ""ग्रह पर हर एक व्यक्ति के लिए उनकी अपनी भाषा में उच्चतम संभव गुणवत्ता का एक मुफ्त विश्वकोश बनाने और वितरित करने का एक प्रयास""। 
[121] हालाँकि प्रत्येक भाषा संस्करण कम या अधिक स्वतंत्र रूप से कार्य करता है, उन सब पर निगरानी रखने के लिए कुछ प्रयास किये जाते हैं। 
वे आंशिक रूप से मेटा विकी के द्वारा समन्वित किये जाते हैं, विकिमीडिया फाउंडेशन का विकी इसकी सभी परियोजनाओं (विकिपीडिया और अन्य) के रख रखाव के लिए समर्पित है।
[122] उदाहरण के लिए, मेटा-विकी विकिपीडिया के सभी भाषा संस्करणों पर महत्वपूर्ण आंकडे उपलब्ध करता है,[123] और यह हर विकिपीडिया में आवश्यक लेखों की सूची रखता है।[124] यह सूची विषय के अनुसार मूल अवयवों से प्रसंग रखती है: जीवनी, इतिहास, भूगोल, समाज, संस्कृति, विज्ञान, प्रौद्योगिकी, खाद्य पदार्थ और गणित.",Hindi
"शेष के लिए, विशेष भाषा से सम्बंधित लेख के लिए अन्य संस्करणों में समकक्ष न होना दुर्लभ नहीं है। उदाहरण के लिए, संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका में छोटे शहरों के बारे में लेख केवल अंग्रेजी में ही उपलब्ध हो सकते हैं। अनुवादित लेख अधिकांश संस्करणों में लेख के एक छोटे हिस्से का प्रतिनिधित्व करते हैं, क्योंकि लेखों के स्वचालित अनुवाद की अनुमति नहीं होती है। 
[125] एक से अधिक भाषा में उपलब्ध लेख ""इंटरविकी"" लिंक पेश कर सकते हैं, जो अन्य संस्करणों के समकक्ष लेखों से सम्बंधित होते हैं। विकिपीडिया लेखों के संग्रह ऑप्टिकल डिस्क्स पर प्रकाशित किया गया है। एक अंग्रेजी संस्करण, 2006 विकिपीडिया CD सलेक्शन में लगभग 2,000 लेख शामिल थे।[126][127] पॉलिश संस्करण में लगभग 240,000 लेख शामिल हैं।[128] जर्मन संस्करण भी उपलब्ध हैं।[129] अपने लेखों की संख्या में तार्किक विकास के अलावा,[130] 2001 में अपनी स्थापना के बाद से विकिपीडिया ने एक आम सन्दर्भ वेबसाइट के रूप में दर्जा प्राप्त किया है।[131] अलेक्सा और कॉमस्कोर के अनुसार, दुनिया भर में विकिपीडिया उन अग्रणी दस वेबसाईटों में है जिस पर लोग सबसे ज्यादा जाते हैं।[10][132] शीर्ष दस में से, विकिपीडिया ही एकमात्र गैर लाभ वेबसाइट है। गूगल खोज परिणामों में इसके प्रमुख स्थान द्वारा विकिपीडिया के विकास को प्रोत्साहित किया गया है;[133] विकिपीडिया में आने वाले सर्च इंजन ट्रेफिक का लगभग 50% गूगल से आता है,[134] जिसमें से एक बड़ा भाग अकादमिक अनुसंधान से संबंधित है।[135] अप्रैल 2007 में प्यू इन्टरनेट और अमेरिकन लाइफ परियोजना ने यह पाया कि एक तिहाई अमेरिकी इंटरनेट उपयोगकर्ता विकिपीडिया से सलाह लेते हैं।[136] अक्टूबर 2006 में, साइट का एक काल्पनिक खपत मूल्य अनुमानतः $ 580 मिलियन था, अगर साईट ने विज्ञापन चलाये.",Hindi
"[137] विकिपीडिया के अवयवों को अकादमिक अध्ययन, पुस्क्तकों, सम्मेलनों और अदालत के मामले में प्रयुक्त किया गया है।[138][139][140]कनाडा की संसद की वेबसाइट में, सिविल विवाह अधिनियम के लिए, इसके ""आगे पठन"" की सूची के ""सम्बंधित लिंक्स"" सेक्शन में समान लिंग विवाह पर विकिपीडिया के लेख से सम्बन्ध रखती है।[141] विश्वकोश की स्वीकृतियों को संगठनों जैसे यू॰एस॰ फेडरल कोर्ट और विश्व बौद्धिक संपदा संगठन के द्वारा प्रयुक्त किया जाता है[142]- हालाँकि मुख्य रूप से इनका उपयोग मुख्य रूप से एक मामले के लिए जानकारी के फैसले से अधिक जानकारी के समर्थन के लिए होता है। [143] विकिपीडिया पर प्रकट होने वाले अवयव कुछ अमेरिकी खुफिया एजेंसीयों की रिपोर्ट में एक स्रोत के रूप में उद्धृत किये गए हैं। [144] दिसम्बर 2008 में वैज्ञानिक पत्रिका RNA बायोलोजी ने RNA अणुओं के वर्ग के वर्णन के लिए एक नया सेक्शन शुरू किया और इसे ऐसे लेखकों की जरुरत होती है जो विकिपीडिया में प्रकाशन के लिए RNA वर्ग पर एक ड्राफ्ट लेख लिखने में मदद करते हैं। [145] विकिपीडिया को पत्रकारिता में एक स्रोत के रूप में इस्तेमाल किया गया है,[146] कभी कभी बिना गुणधर्मों के ऐसा किया गया और कई पत्रकारों को विकिपीडिया से नक़ल करने के लिए बर्खास्त किया गया।[147][148][149]
जुलाई 2007 में, विकिपीडियाने बीबीसी रेडियो 4 पर 30 मिनट के एक वृत्तचित्र को प्रस्तुत किया,[150] जिसने तर्क दिया कि, उपयोगिता और जागरूकता के बढ़ने के साथ लोकप्रिय संस्कृति में विकिपीडिया के सन्दर्भ की संख्या इस प्रकार से है कि टर्म 21 वीं सदी की संज्ञाओं के एक चयन बैंड में से एक है जो बहुत लोकप्रिय हैं (गूगल, फेसबुक, यूट्यूब) कि वे उन्हने अधिक व्याख्या की जरुरत नहीं होती है और हूवरिंग और कोक की तरह 20 वीं सदी के टर्म्स के समतुल्य हैं। कई हास्यास्पद विकिपीडिया का खुलापन, ऑनलाइन विश्वकोश परियोजना लेखों के संशोधन या विध्वंस प्रवृति के पात्रों को दर्शाता हैं। 
विशेष रूप से, हास्य अभिनेता स्टीफन कोल्बेर्ट ने अपने शो द कोलबर्ट रिपोर्ट के असंख्य प्रकरणों में विकिपीडिया किए हास्य का प्रयोग किया है और इसके लिए एक शब्द दिया ""विकिअलिटी"".",Hindi
"[64] इस साइटने मीडिया के कई रूपों पर एक प्रभाव पैदा किया है। कुछ मीडिया स्रोत त्रुटियों के लिए विकिपीडिया की संवेदनशीलता पर व्यंग्य करते हैं, जैसे जुलाई 2006 में द अनियन में मुख पृष्ठ का लेख जिसका शीर्षक था ""विकिपीडिया सेलेब्रेट्स 750 इयर्स ऑफ़ अमेरिकन इंडीपेनडेंस.""",Hindi
"[151] अन्य विकिपीडिया के बारे में कहते हैं कि कोई भी संपादन कर सकता है जैसे द ऑफिस के एक प्रकरण ""द नेगोशिएशन"", जिसमें पात्र माइकल स्कॉट ने कहा, ""विकिपीडिया एक सबसे अच्छी चीज है"".",Hindi
"इस दुनिया में कोई भी किसी भी विषय के बारे में कुछ भी लिख सकता है, इसलिए आप जानते हैं कि आपको सर्वोत्तम संभव जानकारी मिल रही है।"" कुछ चयनित विकिपीडिया की नीतियों जैसे xkcd स्ट्रिप को ""विकिपिडियन प्रोटेस्टर"" नाम दिया गया है। अप्रैल 2008 में डच फिल्म निर्माता एईजेसब्रांड वॉन वीलेन ने अपने 45 मिनट के टेलीविजन वृत्तचित्र ""द ट्रुथ अकार्डिंग टु विकिपीडिया"" का प्रसारण किया।[152] विकिपीडिया के बारे में एक और वृत्तचित्र शीर्षक "" ट्रुथ इन नंबर्स: द विकिपीडिया स्टोरी"" 2009 प्रदर्शन के लिए निर्धारित है। कई महाद्वीपों पर शूट की गयी, यह फिल्म विकिपीडिया के इतिहास और दुनिया भर में विकिपीडिया के संपादकों के साथ किये गए साक्षात्कारों को कवर करेगी। [153][154] 28 सितंबर 2007 को, इतालवी राजनीतिज्ञ फ्रेंको ग्रिल्लिनी ने चित्रमाला की स्वतंत्रता की आवश्यकता के बारे में सांस्कृतिक संसाधन और गतिविधियों के मंत्री के सम्नाक्ष संसदीय प्रश्न उठाया। उन्होंने कहा कि ऐसी आजादी की कमी विकिपीडिया पर दबाव बनाती है,"" जो सातवीं ऐसी वेबसाईट है जिस पर लोग विजित करते हैं"" यह आधुनिक इतालवी इमारतों और कला की सभी छवियों पर रोक लगाती है और दावा किया कि इसने पर्यटन राजस्व को बेहद क्षति पहुँचायी है। 
[155] 16 सितंबर 2007 को द वाशिंगटन पोस्ट ने सूचना दी कि विकिपीडिया 2008 अमेरिकी चुनाव अभियान में एक केंद्र बिन्दु बन गया, इसके अनुसार ""जब आप गूगल में उम्मीदवार का नाम टाइप करते हैं, एक विकिपीडिया पृष्ठ ही पहला परिणाम होता है, यह इन प्रविष्टियों को उतना ही महत्वपूर्ण बनता है जितना कि एक उम्मीदवार को परिभाषित करना.",Hindi
"पहले से ही, राष्ट्रपति प्रविष्टियों को प्रतिदिन अनगिनत बार संपादित, अवलोकित किया जा रहा है और इस पर विचार-विमर्श किया जा रहा है।"" [156] अक्टूबर 2007 के रायटर्स लेख शीर्षक ""विकिपीडिया पेज द लेटेस्ट स्टेटस सिम्बल"" में इस घटना पर रिपोर्ट दी गयी कि कैसे एक विकिपीडिया लेख किसी की विख्याति को साबित करता है।[157] विकिपीडिया ने मई 2004 में दो प्रमुख पुरस्कार जीते। [158] पहला था, वार्षिक प्रिक्स अर्स इलेक्ट्रोनिका प्रतियोगिता में गोल्डन निका फॉर डिजीटल कमयूनिटीस; यह पुरस्कार € 10000 (£ 6588; $ 12,700) अनुदान के साथ आया था और इसके साथ ऑस्ट्रिया में पी ए ई सइबरआर्ट्स समारोह में उस वर्ष दस्तावेज़ करने के लिए एक निमंत्रण भी प्राप्त किया गया था। 
दूसरा, ""समुदाय"" श्रेणी के लिए में न्यायाधीशों का वेब्बी अवार्ड था।[159] विकिपीडिया को ""बेस्ट प्रक्टिसस"" वेब्बी के लिए मनोनीत किया गया। 26 जनवरी 2007 को, विकिपीडिया को ब्रांडचैनल.कॉम के पाठकों द्वारा सर्वोत्तम चौथी ब्रांड श्रेणी से सम्मानित किया गया था; ""किस ब्रांड ने 2006 में हमारे जीवन पर सर्वाधिक प्रभाव डाला"" सवाल के जवाब में 15% मतदान प्राप्त किया गया।[160] सितम्बर 2008 में, विकिपीडिया ने बोरिस टाडिक, एकार्ट होफ्लिंग और पीटर गेब्रियल के साथ वेर्कस्टाट डॉइशलैंड का क्वाडि्ृगा अ मिशन ऑफ़ एनलाइटएनमेंट पुरस्कार प्राप्त किया। यह पुरस्कार जिमी वेल्स को डेविड वेंबेर्गेर द्वारा पेश किया गया।[161] जनता द्वारा लिखित इंटरैक्टिव मल्टीमीडिया विश्वकोश की असंख्य प्रविष्टियाॅं, विकिपीडिया की स्थापना से भी लंबे (लम्बे) समय पहले मौजूद थीं। इनमें से पहला था 1986 BBC डोमस्डे प्रोजेक्ट, जिसमें ब्रिटेन के 1 मिलियन से अधिक योगदानकर्ताओं के पाठ्य (BBC माइक्रो कंप्यूटर पर प्रविष्ट) और तस्वीरें शामिल थीं और यह ब्रिटेन के भूगोल, कला और संस्कृति को कवर करता था। यह पहला इंटरैक्टिव मल्टीमीडिया विश्वकोश था (और साथ ही आंतरिक लिंक्स के माध्यम से जुड़ा पहला मुख्य मल्टीमीडिया दस्तावेज़ भी था), इसमें अधिकांश लेख ब्रिटेन के एक इंटरेक्टिव मानचित्र के माध्यम से उपलब्ध थे। उपयोगकर्ता इंटरफ़ेस और डोमस्डे प्रोजेक्ट के अवयवों के एक हिस्से को अब एक वेबसाईट पर डाल दिया गया है। [162] सबसे सफल प्रारंभिक ऑनलाइन विश्वकोशों में से एक था h2g2 जिस पर जनता के द्वारा प्रविष्टियाँ की जाती थीं, जिसे डगलस एडम्स के द्वारा निर्मित किया गया और इसे BBC के द्वारा चलाया जाता है। h2g2 विश्वकोश तुलनात्मक रूप से हल्का फुल्का था, यह उन लेखों पर ध्यान केन्द्रित करता था जो हास्यपूर्ण भी हों और जानकारीपूर्ण भी हों।
इन दोनों परियोजनाओं में विकिपीडिया के साथ समानता थी, लेकिन दोंनों में से किसी ने भी सार्वजनिक उपयोगकर्ताओं को पूर्ण संपादकीय स्वतंत्रता नहीं दी। ऐसी ही एक गैर-विकी परियोजना GNU पीडिया परियोजना, अपने इतिहास के आरम्भ में न्यूपीडिया के साथ उपस्थित थी; हालाँकि इसे सेवानिवृत्त कर दिया गया है और इसके निर्माता मुफ्त सॉफ्टवेयर व्यक्ति रिचर्ड स्टालमेन ने विकिपीडिया को समर्थन दिया है। 
[21] विकिपीडिया ने कई सम्बन्धी परियोजनाओं का सूत्रपात भी किया है, इन्हें भी विकिमीडिया फाउंडेशन द्वारा संचालित किया जाता है। पहला, ""इन मेमोरियम: सितंबर 11 विकी"",[163] अक्टूबर 2002 में निर्मित,[164] जो 11 सितंबर के हमलों को विस्तृत किया; इस परियोजना को अक्टूबर 2006 में बंद कर दिया गया था। विकटियोनरी, एक शब्दकोश परियोजना, दिसंबर 2002 में शुरू की गई थी;[165] विकिकोट कोटेशन्स का एक संग्रह, जो विकिमीडिया के उदघाटन के एक सप्ताह बाद शुरू हुआ और विकिबुक्स सहयोग से लिखी गयी मुफ्त पुस्तकों का एक संग्रह.",Hindi
"तब से विकिमीडिया ने कई अन्य परियोजनाएं शुरू की हैं, इसमें विकीवर्सिटी भी शामिल है, यह मुफ्त अध्ययन सामग्री के निर्माण के लिए और ऑनलाइन शिक्षण गतिविधियों का प्रावधान करने की परियोजना है। 
[166] हालाँकि, इन में से कोई भी सम्बंधित परियोजना, विकिपीडिया की सफलता प्राप्ति में सहायक नहीं रही है। विकिपीडिया की जानकारी के कुछ उपसमुच्चय अक्सर विशिष्ट उद्देश्य के लिए अतिरिक्त समीक्षा के साथ विकसित किये गए हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, विकिपीडीयन्स और SOS बच्चों के द्वारा निर्मित CD /DVD की विकिपीडिया श्रृंखला (उर्फ ""विकिपीडिया फॉर स्कूल्स""), एक मुफ्त, हाथ से जांच की गयी, विकिपीडिया से गैर वाणिज्यिक चुनाव है, जो ब्रिटेन के राष्ट्रीय पाठ्यक्रम में लक्षित है और अधिकांश अंग्रेजी भाषी दुनिया के लिए उपयोगी है। 
विकिपीडिया फॉर स्कूल्स ऑनलाइन उपलब्ध है: एक समकक्ष प्रिंट विश्वकोश के लिए लगभग बीस संस्करणों की आवश्यकता होगी।
ये विकिपीडिया के लेख के एक सलेक्ट सबसेट को एक मुद्रित पुस्तक रूप देने का प्रयास भी किया गया है।
[167] सहयोगी ज्ञान आधार विकास पर केन्द्रित अन्य वेबसाईटों ने या तो विकिपीडिया से प्रेरणा प्राप्त की है या उसे प्रेरित किया है।
कुछ, जैसे सुस्निंग.नु (Susning.nu), एनसिक्लोपेडिया लीब्रे (Enciclopedia Libre) और विकिज़नानी (WikiZnanie) किसी औपचारिक समीक्षा प्रक्रिया का इस्तेमाल नहीं करते है, जबकि अन्य जैसे एनसाइक्लोपीडिया ऑफ़ लाइफ (Encyclopedia of Life), स्टैनफोर्ड एनसाइक्लोपीडिया ऑफ़ फिलोसोफी (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), स्कोलरपीडिया (Scholarpedia), h2g2, एव्रीथिंग2 (Everything2), अधिक पारंपरिक सहकर्मी समीक्षा का उपयोग करते है। एक ऑनलाइन विश्वकोश, सिटिज़नडियम को विकिपीडिया के सह-संस्थापक लैरी सेंगर के द्वारा विकिपीडिया के ""विशेषज्ञ अनुकूल"" का निर्माण करने के प्रयास में शुरू किया गया था।[168][169][170] निर्देशांक: 37°47′13″N 122°23′59″W﻿ / ﻿37.78697°N 122.399677°W﻿ / 37.78697; -122.399677 विकिमीडिया संस्थान एक अमेरिकी गैर-लाभकारी संस्थान है, जिसका मुख्यालय सैन फ्रांसिस्को, कैलिफोर्निया में स्थित है। इसकी स्थापना जिमी वेल्स ने 20 जून 2003 को की थी। यह दान में प्राप्त पैसों से संचालित होता है। इस संस्थान की सबसे अधिक प्रसिद्ध परियोजना विकिपीडिया है। इसके अलावा भी कई अन्य परियोजनाओं को शुरू किया गया था। जिसमें विक्षनरी (शब्दकोश), विकिस्रोत, विकिसमाचार, विकिसूक्ति, विकिपुस्तक, विकियात्रा आदि हैं। इसके अलावा कई ऐसे प्रकल्प भी है, जिसमें सभी भाषाओं के सदस्य योगदान देते हैं। इसमें मेटा विकि, इनक्यूबेटर, कॉमन्स आदि हैं। विकिमीडिया संस्थान का उद्देश्य मुफ्त लाइसेंस या सार्वजनिक कार्यक्रम (public domain) के अन्तर्गत, शैक्षणिक सामग्री एकत्रित करके विश्व के लोगों को सशक्त एवं व्यस्त बनाना, एवं इसे भूमण्डल में प्रभाविकता से प्रसारित करना है। अध्यायों के अन्तरजाल की सहायता से, संस्थान एक से अधिक भाषा के लिये विकि प्रोजेक्ट एवं अन्य प्रयत्न, जो कि उद्देश्य की और अग्रसर है, की सहायता एवं विकास के लिये मूलभूत और संगठित ढांचा प्रदान करता है। संस्थान इन प्रॉजेक्ट्स की मदद से निरन्तर इंटरनेट पर मुफ्त उपयोगी सूचना उपलब्ध करायेगा। विकिमीडिया फ्लोरिडा, अमेरिका के कानून के अंतर्गत एक बिना-लाभार्जन की दानपुण्य संस्था है। पूरी तरह से हिसाब रखने वाला विकिमीडिया संस्थान गाइडस्टार एवं इसकी भागीदार साइटों पर एक दानपुण्य संस्था के रूप में सूचित है। विकिमिडिया संस्थान अमेरिका में ५०१(सी)(३) कर-मुक्त स्थिति में है। विकिमीडिया संस्थान प्रसिद्ध कार्यकारी एनसायक्लोपीडिया, विकिपीडिया, २००६ के अंत तक विश्व में सबसे ज्यादा देखी जाने वाली १५ वेबसाइटों में से एक, को सहयोग देता है। जनवरी, २००१ में विकिपीडिया की स्थापना, एवं जून, २००३ में विकिमीडिया संस्थान की समविष्टि से इसकी प्रगति विस्मयित रही है। अंग्रेजी-भाषा विकिपीडिया, इसका प्रथम कार्यक्रम, समाविष्टि के बाद से १.३५ लाख लेखों से आज १५० लाख लेख तक पहुँच गया है। ३९ अन्य-भाषाओं की विकिपीडिया पर अपनी भाषा में १००,००० से ज्यादा लेख लिखे जा चुके हैं। साथ ही साथ, संस्थान विकिपीडिया के अतिरिक्त, अन्य कई प्रोजेक्टों को संचालित करता है, जैसे कि विकिमीडिया कोमन्स, मुफ्त चित्रों एवं मीडिया का संग्रहण, जिसने नवंबर २००६ में दस लाख चित्रों का आंकडा पार किया है। विक्शनरी, मुफ्त शब्दकोष, ८ अलग-अलग भाषाओं में ५०,००० शब्दों से ज्यादा प्रविष्टियां रखता है, जिनमें से तीन २००,००० से ज्यादा परिभाषायें रखते हैं। विकिसोर्स, एक भौतिक स्रोत संग्रहण, लगभग १५०,००० पृष्टों का संग्रहण है। विकिकोटे (उद्धरण), विकिबुक्स (आपसी सहयोग से लिखी पुस्तकें), विकिन्यूज (नगरीय समाचार पत्र), विकिवर्सिटी (पाठ्यक्रम विकास), ये सब उसी रफ्तार से अग्रसर है। कुल मिलाकर, इन कार्यक्रम में ७८ लाख से अधिक पृष्ट, २२ लाख से अधिक चित्र, एवं ५० लाख से अधिक पंजीकृत खाते हैं। विकिट्रेवल, ओमेगाविकि, एवं विकिआ, संस्थान के द्वारा संचालित कार्यक्रम नहीं है। अंग्रेज़ी (w)  · सेबुआनो (w)  ·

.हम सभी अंग्रेजी में और अधिक धाराप्रवाह बनने के त्वरित तरीकों की तलाश कर रहे हैं, मुझे पता है कि मुझे पता है कि क्या होता है कि हमारे मस्तिष्क को चक्कर लगाने वाले कुछ शब्द हैं और हमें इस पूरी बातचीत को केवल अद्भुत अद्भुत शांत या महाकाव्य का उपयोग करने की आवश्यकता है ताकि हम कैसे हो कुछ नए नए अंग्रेजी शब्द सीखें जिन्हें आप अपने दैनिक जीवन में उपयोग कर सकते हैं और अपनी शब्दावली मिनटों में बढ़ा सकते हैं। तो आज हम 10 नए स्मार्ट शब्दों को सीखने के लिए जा रहे हैं उनके अर्थ मूल शब्द और उदाहरण वाक्य ताकि हम जा रहे हैं अरे यह सब हो रहा है और आप देख रहे हैं। और इस वीडियो में मैं आपको दैनिक उपयोग के लिए और इस वीडियो के अंत में 10 स्मार्ट शब्द देने जा रहा हूं। मैं भी आपको वास्तव में धाराप्रवाह स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या ध्वनि करने के लिए एक स्मार्ट टिप देने जा रहा हूं। एक दलित दलदल में बह जाने का मतलब है डूबना या बाढ़ आना लेकिन दलदल का इस्तेमाल अक्सर काम के संदर्भ में किया जाता है जैसे कि ' काम के साथ मैं बहुत ज्यादा काम करने के लिए तैयार हूँ, मुझे इस पूरे हफ्ते काम के साथ दलदली होना पड़ा है और मुश्किल से सांस लेने का समय मिला है अब इस शब्द की जड़ को देखते हैं। दलदल आर्द्रभूमि का एक टुकड़ा है और अगर कोई दलदल में गलत जगह पर कदम रखता है तो वे आसानी से डूब सकते हैं और दलदल का क्रिया रूप डूबने का मतलब है कि यहां आप इस शब्द का उपयोग कैसे कर सकते हैं। मान लीजिए कि आपके पास बहुत सारे असाइनमेंट हैं और आपके पास एक परीक्षा आ रही है और आपके मित्र आपके पास आते हैं और वे कहते हैं। अरे, आप हमारे साथ क्यों नहीं घूमते हैं, आप उनसे कह सकते हैं कि मुझे बहुत खेद है, लेकिन मैं काम से बह गया हूं या मैंने कुछ अन्य शब्दों को स्वाहा कर दिया है, जिनका उपयोग आप दलदली के स्थान पर कर सकते हैं, मुझे बहुत अधिक मिला है ऐसा करने के लिए। मेरी प्लेट पर बहुत अधिक है मैं काम में डूब रहा हूं। मैं असाइनमेंट के साथ बहक गया हूँ स्मार्ट शब्द नंबर दो को पकड़ना है -22 अब मुझे यकीन है ' इस शब्द को कैच -22 से पहले सुना है, इसका मतलब एक असंभव स्थिति है जिसमें आप एक काम नहीं कर सकते हैं जब तक कि आपने दूसरे को नहीं किया है और आप दूसरे को नहीं कर सकते क्योंकि आपने पहले नहीं किया है। मैंने आपको भ्रमित किया है ताकि मैं आपको कुछ उदाहरण दे सकूं, जब आपको कार्य अनुभव के बिना नौकरी नहीं मिलती है, तो यह एक स्थिति है। लेकिन आप अनुभव प्राप्त नहीं कर सकते हैं जब तक कि आप एक नौकरी पकड़ने -22 प्राप्त नहीं करते हैं, जोसेफ हेलर द्वारा उसी नाम कैच -22 की अपनी प्रसिद्ध पुस्तक में गढ़ा गया था जब वह कुछ विरोधाभासी नियमों का वर्णन कर रहे थे जो विश्व युद्ध दो के दौरान सैनिकों पर लागू थे। कैच -22 का एक और उदाहरण आपको बैंक ऋण की आवश्यकता है क्योंकि आपके पास पर्याप्त नहीं है। जब तक आप बैंक को यह साबित नहीं कर देते कि आपके पास पर्याप्त पैसा है, तब तक आपको वह बैंक ऋण नहीं मिलेगा, अगली बार जब आप मुश्किल स्थिति में फंसेंगे तो याद रखें। शब्द -22 का उपयोग करने के लिए। और इन प्रशंसात्मक शब्दों को अपने दोस्तों के दूसरे शब्दों से प्राप्त करें जिन्हें आप कैच -22 के स्थान पर उपयोग कर सकते हैं वे विरोधाभास या दुविधा वाले स्मार्ट शब्द हैं। नंबर तीन है सवेव सवेव का अर्थ है विनम्र शांत और परिष्कृत होने के लिए परिष्कृत होना। सुविचारित शब्द सुवे के कई अलग-अलग मूल हैं लेकिन शब्द का एक बहुत ही रोचक मूल है जिसका अर्थ है सुखद या मीठा स्वाद। वह विशेष रूप से महिलाओं या बराक ओबामा के सामने इतनी मार्मिक और सुसाइड करने वाली है कि अब अगली बार किसी पार्टी में जाने पर उसे याद रखना बहुत आसान और पॉलिश है और आप इस व्यक्ति को देखते हैं। सुव्यवस्थित और सुसंस्कृत और परिष्कृत। यह कहना न भूलें कि इस शब्द का उपयोग करने वाले कोने में उस आदमी का अधिकार है, जो तुरंत आपकी शब्दावली का उपयोग करेगा। बहुत suave इसलिए स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या चार पर अत्याचार अत्याचारी शब्द है, अत्याचारी शब्द का अर्थ है, वास्तव में बुरा भयानक भयानक क्रूर, जो आक्रामक अत्याचार को भड़काने वाला लैटिन शब्द है। जिसका अर्थ है कि क्रूर या भयानक शब्द का कुछ उदाहरण है कि अत्याचारी शब्द डेल्ही में हाल ही में हुई बलात्कार की घटनाएं हैं। या कैदियों का इलाज किया जाता है। जेल में कभी-कभी अत्याचारपूर्ण तरीके से कुछ सामान्य गलत कामों के बारे में बात करने के लिए दिन-प्रतिदिन अत्याचार का भी उपयोग किया जाता है और आप इसे अतिरंजित करना चाहते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए उनके टेबल मैनर्स अत्याचारी थे या उनकी पोशाक भावना इतनी अत्याचारी है या उनका व्याकरण अत्याचारी है। तो अगली बार जब आप समाचार पर एक भयावह कार्य के बारे में याद करते हैं। टिप्पणी और कहना है कि यह एक अत्याचारी कृत्य है स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 5 मूर्ख, मूर्ख, मूर्ख, अद्भुत आश्चर्यजनक है। अब हम अक्सर यहाँ भयानक शब्द का उपयोग करते हैं ' एक और शब्द जो आप उदाहरण के लिए भयानक बेवकूफ़ के स्थान पर उपयोग कर सकते हैं आज मुझे मेरे परीक्षण पर एक शानदार स्कोर मिला जिसका मतलब है कि मुझे एक बहुत ही उच्च स्कोर मिला या। मुझे एक सही-सही अंक मिला है कि शब्द के शब्द का अर्थ है कि शब्द का शास्त्रीय लैटिन मूल जड़ है। स्तब्ध रह जाना इतना मूर्खतापूर्ण है कि किसी चीज का वर्णन करने के लिए प्रयोग किया जाता है जो आश्चर्यजनक रूप से अच्छा होता है उदाहरण के लिए वह उस पोशाक में शानदार दिखती है या इस बालकनी से क्या शानदार दृश्य है या मैं इस मूर्खतापूर्ण पुस्तक को पढ़ रहा हूं कि मैं नीचे नहीं जा सकता कि कैसे जाना है और कहना। आपके मित्र जो छात्रों के लिए यह बेवकूफी भरा चैनल है और कुछ अन्य शब्द जो आप बेवकूफ़ के बजाय इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं वे अविश्वसनीय शानदार या असाधारण रूप से अच्छे हैं इसलिए इससे पहले कि हम इस वीडियो पर एक टिप्पणी डालने के लिए याद रखें इस वीडियो पर संतुलित पाँच शब्द जारी रखें। मुझे यह बताने के लिए कि इन दस शब्दों में से आपका पसंदीदा स्मार्ट शब्द नंबर छह कौन सा है, एक फ़िक्स में ठीक होने का मतलब है उदाहरण के लिए एक परेशानी की स्थिति में होना, मैं एक तय समय में हूँ क्योंकि मैंने इसके लिए दो अलग-अलग दोस्तों के साथ योजना बनाई है संध्या। मैंने अपना फोन खो दिया है और मैं ठीक कर रहा हूं या हमारी बस आज सुबह टूट गई है और मैं ठीक कर रहा हूं मेरे दोस्त हमेशा मदद के लिए मेरे पास जाते हैं जब वह ठीक होता है और जब वह अच्छा होता है तो वह भूल जाता है। अगली बार जब आप उदाहरण के लिए स्कूल से गणित का होमवर्क प्राप्त करते हैं और यदि आपने अपनी गणित की किताब स्कूल में छोड़ दी है, तो आप अपने दोस्तों को बता सकते हैं कि आप एक वास्तविक फिक्स में हैं, अब आप सोच सकते हैं कि शब्द फिक्स का कुछ करना है कुछ मरम्मत के साथ। लेकिन एक फिक्स में कोई भी परेशानी का मतलब नहीं है एक परेशानी की स्थिति में दूसरे शब्दों का उपयोग करें जिन्हें आप एक फिक्स में उपयोग कर सकते हैं मैं एक सूप में हूं या मैं ' एक गड़बड़ में हूँ या मैं परेशान के एक स्थान पर हूँ या बस मैं एक स्पॉट में हूँ स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 7 है फ्लुमॉक्स फ्लुमोक्स का मतलब किसी को भ्रमित करना है। इतना है कि वे भूल जाते हैं कि अब क्या करना है उलझन में एक अति प्रयोग शब्द हो जाता है तो इसके बजाय आप उदाहरण के लिए flummox का उपयोग क्यों नहीं करते हैं। लड़का पूरी तरह से दिखता है ।flummoxed जब शिक्षक ने उसे कक्षा में एक सवाल पूछा या कुत्ते को देख शराबी हो गया। दर्पण में अपने स्वयं के प्रतिबिंब या पर्यटक को अलग-अलग रीति-रिवाजों से लाद दिया गया था। अपनी यात्रा के दौरान या एक साक्षात्कार के दौरान उनका सामना हुआ, जब उनसे पूछा गया कि हम आपको क्यों काम पर रखें तो अगली बार जब आप किसी परीक्षा में उदाहरण के लिए किसी भी प्रश्न पर भ्रमित हो जाते हैं, तो वह अगली बार पूरी तरह से झुलस गए। हमेशा कह सकते हैं कि क्योंकि मैं था ' परीक्षा के लिए बहुत अच्छी तरह से तैयार किया गया था I कुछ सवालों के झटके से घिरे हुए थे जिन्हें आप flummoxed के बजाय उपयोग कर सकते हैं वे घबराए हुए हैं या हैरान हो गए हैं स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या आठ का एक प्रकार का संगीत दिया गया है। उदाहरण के लिए बैठक या तारीख कहने का एक बहुत ही फ्रेंच तरीका है, मेरे पास शनिवार को दोपहर के भोजन पर अपने दोस्तों के साथ एक मिलन स्थल है या मैं फिल्मों के लिए मॉल में अपने दोस्तों के साथ मुलाकात करने की योजना बना रहा हूं, फिल्मों के लिए एक संज्ञा या एक क्रिया के रूप में इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है उदाहरण के लिए। आज शाम को मैं अपने दोस्तों के साथ एक मुलाकात कर रहा हूँ या मैं कल अपने दोस्तों के साथ मिलने जा रहा हूँ। सेना द्वारा सैनिकों के लिए एक बैठक की जगह को इंगित करने के लिए सेना द्वारा एक बैठक स्थान का संकेत देने के लिए इस्तेमाल किया गया था, अब कुछ संक्षिप्त और गुप्त शब्द है, भले ही अब आप किसी भी बैठक के लिए मुलाकात का उपयोग कर सकते हैं। सामान्य तौर पर लेकिन यह जीता ' आधिकारिक मीटिंग के लिए टी बहुत उपयुक्त है, इसलिए यदि आपके पास एक तारीख है, तो आप निश्चित रूप से कह सकते हैं कि एक गूढ़ स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 9 है, जो कि आपत्तिजनक है, यह एक अपमान है जिसे आप इसका उपयोग तब करेंगे जब आप किसी को गूंगा या अनजाने में कॉल करने का प्रयास कर रहे हों। या मंद-व्यंजित अब आपने सुना है शब्द ज्यामिति obtuse कोण और तीव्र कोण में इसलिए एक obtuse कोण 90 डिग्री से अधिक कोण है, लेकिन 180 डिग्री से कम है। और एक तीव्र कोण यह तीक्ष्ण कोण है जो 90 डिग्री से कम इतना तीव्र है क्योंकि एक शब्द का उपयोग तीखे को व्यक्त करने के लिए किया जाता है और इसलिए मानसिक रूप से भी तेज है और इसलिए कि यह कुंद कुंद करने से इनकार कर रहा है। तो यह भी मन में थोड़ा धीमा होता है इसलिए उदाहरण के साथ अपशब्द भी आदमी होते हैं। ऐसा करने के लिए वह एक फर्जी कॉल करने वाला बच्चा या मोटापे से ग्रस्त बच्चे को अपना पासवर्ड दे देता था। सक्षम नहीं था। परीक्षण पर एक ही सवाल का जवाब देने के लिए या मोटापे से ग्रस्त व्यक्ति को एक कठिन समय था यहां तक ​​कि बुनियादी निर्देशों को समझना अब दैनिक जीवन में आपकी स्थिति में है कि आपका प्रेमी या आपकी प्रेमिका आपसे नाराज है और आपको नहीं पता कि आप ऐसा क्यों कर सकते हैं। उनसे कहें कि शायद मैं अडिग हूं, लेकिन मुझे नहीं पता कि आप इतने परेशान क्यों हैं कि स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 10 सुस्त सुस्त सुस्त है, धीमे धीमे चलने के लिए धीमी गति से चलने का मतलब है। सामान्य से थोड़ा थका हुआ और कमी महसूस करने के लिए। ऊर्जा उदाहरण में एक भारी दोपहर का भोजन मुझे दोपहर में बहुत सुस्त बना देता है शब्द से जड़ें होती हैं जिसका अर्थ है कि एक धीमा व्यक्ति और एक सुस्त एक जानवर है जो घोंघे के उदाहरणों की तरह वास्तव में बहुत धीरे-धीरे चलता है। इस साल अर्थव्यवस्था बहुत सुस्त रही है या मैच की शुरुआत सुस्त रही। या व्यवसाय इस तिमाही में सुस्त रहा है आप इसे अपने दैनिक जीवन में उपयोग कर सकते हैं यदि आप एक दिन बहुत थक गए हैं तो आप अपनी माँ को बता सकते हैं या आप बता सकते हैं। आपके दोस्त मुझे बहुत सुस्त लग रहे हैं। आज मैं एनर्जी ड्रिंक के साथ दूसरे शब्दों का उपयोग कर सकता हूं जिन्हें आप सुस्त के स्थान पर उपयोग कर सकते हैं, सुस्त हो सकते हैं या मेरे पैरों को खींच सकते हैं, इसलिए वे 10 स्मार्ट शब्द और पहले थे। मैं आपको उस गुप्त टिप को बहुत धाराप्रवाह ध्वनि देने के लिए देता हूं जिसे मैं आपको याद दिलाना चाहता हूं। यदि आप स्मार्ट शब्दों को टेलीफोन कॉल पर उपयोग करने के लिए देख रहे हैं तो मैं एक वीडियो का लिंक डाल रहा हूं। उस के लिए विवरण बॉक्स में नीचे और अब ध्वनि धाराप्रवाह के लिए गुप्त टिप को एक से अधिक स्मार्ट शब्द या वाक्य का उपयोग नहीं करना है जो वे कभी-कभी जानते हैं। हम बहुत उत्साहित हैं क्योंकि हम ' इन स्मार्ट शब्दों की एक पूरी बहुत कुछ सीखा है और हम उनमें से दो तीन चार को एक वाक्य में लिख देते हैं जो स्वाभाविक नहीं लगता है। इसलिए एक समय में सुनिश्चित करें कि आप उच्चारण कर रहे हैं। सही तरीके से शब्द Google पर जाएं और शब्द लिखें और शीर्ष पर दाईं ओर खोज में आपको एक छोटा स्पीकर आइकन दिखाई देगा, उस स्पीकर पर क्लिक करें। और एक या दो बार उच्चारण सुनें। और आप जाने के लिए तैयार हैं और अगर आपको यह वीडियो पसंद आया है तो हमें टिप्पणी के साथ अंगूठा देना न भूलें। मेरे लिए इसके तहत मुझे बता रहा हूँ कि इन 10 शब्दों में से आपका पसंदीदा और क्या है। यदि आपने सदस्यता बटन और घंटी आइकन को पहले से ही दबाया नहीं है और इसे देखना सुखद है। हे दोस्तों इस वीडियो में मेरे चैनल में आपका स्वागत है। मैं आपको शीर्ष 50 अंग्रेजी वाक्यांश देने जा रहा हूं जिन्हें आप अपने रोजमर्रा के जीवन में उपयोग कर सकते हैं। इसलिए यदि आप अपनी यात्रा को शुरू करने वाले हैं। अंग्रेजी बोलने वाले देश के लिए, आप इसका पूरी तरह से उपयोग कर सकते हैं। वाक्यांश यदि

महिला रहती थी जिसका नाम मैरियन था। अपनी इकलौती बेटी के साथ नरसिंह की शादी बेहद विनम्र और मीठी नशीली थी लेकिन पूरी तरह से इसके विपरीत आप देख सकते हैं कि वह उन शब्दों से परे सुंदर थी जो वह एक जीने की तरह थी। गुड़िया और सबसे मनोरंजक हिस्सा वह खुद को प्यार करता है कोई अंत नहीं होगा narcisa तुम। मुझे रोटी बनाने में मदद करें हुह कोई रास्ता नहीं माँ आटा मेरे सभी उज्ज्वल और स्पार्कली आँखें नौकरानियों। narcisa क्या आप मुझे इन बीजों को लगाने में मदद करेंगी कि मैं ऐसा क्यों करूँगी कि मुझे क्या मिला है जो मेरी प्यारी उँगलियों पर यह सब खराब हो गया है, अगर यह मेरे चेहरे पर अच्छी तरह से चला गया तो यह नरसीसा की समस्या थी। उसने खुद को किसी भी काम को करने के लिए बहुत सोचा था कि कई आत्महत्या करने वाले लोग शादी में नशीली वस्तुओं का हाथ मांगने आए थे। चूँकि उसकी सुंदरता दूर-दूर तक जानी जाती थी, लेकिन उसने उन सभी को बहुत ही अशिष्टता से अस्वीकार कर दिया, तो आपने उन पुरुषों को कल क्यों भेज दिया, उन्हें अच्छा लग रहा था कि आप उनमें से एक गंभीर माँ नहीं हो सकती हैं। ऐसी छोटी आँखें लगभग एक चिड़िया की तरह थीं और दूसरी के पास एक बड़ी नाक थी जो मैं उसके पास नहीं होना चाहता था। जब उन्होंने ओह ओह और आखिरी पड़ाव छींक दिया, तो मैं किसी भी अधिक सुनना नहीं चाहता, मैं यह देख सकता था कि वे लोग वास्तव में बहुत अच्छे थे मेरे प्रिय आपको उस सुंदरता को जानना चाहिए। वह सब कुछ नहीं है, जिसे आपको महसूस करना है कि मैं किसी राजकुमार या शूरवीर की तरह हूं। ओह प्रिय एक रात जब वह सो रही थी उसकी माँ उसे देख रही थी। मेरे प्यारे बच्चे तुम बहुत सुंदर और प्यारे हो लेकिन तुम्हें अपनी खूबसूरती के अलावा किसी और चीज की परवाह नहीं है। उस पल में नार्सीसस को नींद में हंसना शुरू कर दिया, उसकी माँ बेहद हैरान थी कि नार्सीसस होने पर अगली सुबह वह वास्तव में कितना मजेदार सपना देख रही होगी। मैं जाग गया कि वह सब मुस्कुरा रही थी और यहाँ पर गिगल्स ने जानेमन को बताया कि तुमने क्या सपना देखा था। कल रात अच्छी तरह से माँ यह एक ऐसा अद्भुत सपना था जिसे आप जानते हैं कि यह राजकुमार था जो मेरे पास आया था। और कहा कि वह मुझसे शादी करना चाहता था, वह एक सुनहरी गाड़ी में आया था और उसने ऊपर से नीचे तक कपड़े पहने थे और सोने के साथ-साथ एक मूर्खतापूर्ण सपना भी था। और आप जानते हैं कि इसका सबसे अच्छा हिस्सा तब था जब मैं अपनी शादी की पोशाक में था, जो सोने का भी था, निश्चित रूप से हर कोई मुझे केवल नरसीसा घूर रहा था, उस सपने के बारे में कुछ भी आश्चर्यजनक नहीं है। यह एक बहुत ही अहंकारी स्वप्न था कि आप यह नहीं जानते कि आप यह कह रहे हैं कि स्वप्न ने मुझे यह एहसास दिलाया है कि मुझे सोने से बने घर की रोटी के प्रकार की तुलना में बहुत अधिक भोजन की आवश्यकता है। ज़रा सोचिए उस गरीब नशीली माँ को अपनी बेटी और उसकी चिंता कैसी थी। वह उस दिन अपना जीवन व्यतीत करेगी, जिस दिन दो दोस्त नार्सिसस मां से मिलने आए थे, वे मधुर थीं और टेरी उन तीनों की उम्र के लिए दोस्त थीं, लेकिन टेरी और एली दोनों का रहस्य था। जादुई प्राणी कुछ ऐसे थे कि नरसी की माँ को टेरी मेली के बारे में कुछ भी नहीं पता था, ओह, यह देखना बहुत अच्छा है कि यह आपको बहुत लंबा है। t यह कि आप कैसे हैं, मैं बहुत अच्छा हूं मैं बेहतर होता अगर केवल तभी अगर मेरी बेटी नार्सीसा केवल थोड़ी और समझ रखने वाली मर्दानी होती जो मेली और टेरी को नार्सीसा के बारे में सब बताती और वह उसके लिए चिंतित रहती कि वह क्या खाना चाहती है। सोने से बनी रोटी मैं उसके साथ क्या कर सकता हूँ अगर उसका सपना सच हो जाए। यह अद्भुत होगा यह अच्छी तरह से कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता मैं समय में लगता है कि वह जानने के लिए बढ़ेगा चलो कुछ और के बारे में बात करते हैं। अब बाद में मैली और टेरी ने अपने पुराने दोस्त को अलविदा कह दिया और उस रात चुपके से एक दूसरे की माँ और बेटी दोनों के पास मुस्कुराते हुए चली गईं। बिस्तर माँ के लिए तैयार हो गया, मुझे आशा है कि मेरा सपना सच होगा, आप जानते हैं कि ओह नार्सीसा अगले दिन नार्किसा और उसकी माँ अपने बगीचे में एक सुंदर के बाहर थीं। सुनहरी गाड़ी उनके ऊपर सवार होकर आई थी, जो कि रत्नों और हीरों में जड़ी हुई थी और बेहद आश्चर्यजनक लग रही थी। जैसा कि इसने एक सुंदर आदमी को रोका, इससे बाहर आया और नरसीसा को देखा कि वह पूरी तरह से इस बात पर अचंभित था कि वह कितना सुंदर था, मेरा सपना वास्तव में सच था। मैं यहाँ शादी में नशा करने के लिए क्या कहने आया हूँ, लेकिन आप उसका नाम कैसे जानते हैं और आप कौन हैं। मैं बहुत खुश हूं कि आपकी बेटी का नाम और उसकी किस्मत अच्छी है और दुनिया भर में जाना जाता है। मैं आपके लिए एक ऐसा उपहार लेकर आया हूं, लेकिन आप शायद ही उसे जानते हों कि आप उसके साथ नहीं जा सकते। ओह मूर्खतापूर्ण वह अमीर और सुंदर है जो मैं चाहता हूं कि मैं आपके प्रस्ताव को स्वीकार कर सकता हूं। और इसके साथ ही वह अपनी गाड़ी में सवार हो गया और बिना अपनी माँ को अलविदा कहे परी के साथ सवार हो गया क्योंकि वे गाड़ी से जा रहे थे कि अचानक गाड़ी एक जादुई पोर्टल में घुस गई, वहाँ एक तूफानी क्षेत्र से गुज़री तो गाड़ी ने चारों ओर से जबरदस्त टक्कर मार दी। बहुत डर गया था कि मेरे प्रिय को यह सब चिंता नहीं होगी क्योंकि वह यह कहेगा कि यह गाड़ी एक अन्य पोर्टल से होकर ड्राइववे तक पहुँच जाएगी। एक विशाल और शानदार सुनहरे महल में नार्किसा ने सारी सुंदरता को देखकर आश्चर्यचकित कर दिया कि उसने देखा कि मैं जानता था कि मैं इतने सारे धनवानों के लायक हूँ, मुझे पता था कि आप इसे चाहते हैं कि आप कुछ भी चाहें, यहाँ आपको सबसे सुंदर कपड़े से लेकर सबसे स्वादिष्ट खाद्य पदार्थ मिलेंगे। मेरे महल में भोजन की अच्छी तरह से बोलना, मैं उस सवारी के बाद सच में भूखा हूँ ' मैं भूखा रह सकता हूँ, लेकिन यहाँ पर जो भी स्वादिष्ट मीट मिस्सा है वह आपको मिलेगा, जो भी आप चाहते हैं, उसके बारे में आपने बहुत सुना होगा। मैं तुम्हें कुछ खाना मिल जाएगा ओह, शुक्रिया, वे भोजन कक्ष में चले गए और मेज पर सबसे आश्चर्यजनक भोजन नार्सीसा कभी अद्भुत देखा था, क्योंकि यह जाम बना रहे हैं। माणिक के सलाद में पन्ना और वहां पर बनी रोटी सोने की सुनहरी रोटी से बनी होती है, यह जाम कितना प्यारा लगेगा और जिस रोटी के साथ उसने स्लाइस ली थी, वह बहुत ही अच्छी लगेगी। उस पर माणिक जाम और एक विशाल काट लिया यह इतना गर्म है मैं इसे अच्छी तरह से नहीं खा सकता यह रोटी सोने से बना है और बेहतरीन भी है लेकिन अगर आप इसे नहीं खा सकते हैं तो मुझे आपको चांदी की रोटी मिलनी चाहिए हुह क्यों नहीं तुम खाते हो। कुछ और लेकिन मुझे सामान्य ब्रेड रोटी चाहिए, जो मैं खा सकता हूं, इसलिए आपको ऐसा नहीं लगता कि मेरी पत्नी की शायरियां ऐसी हैं कि यह ठंडी है, आपको केवल सबसे अच्छा खाना चाहिए, जो सभी भोजन को देखते हुए एल है। लेकिन सब कुछ के लिए दिल टूटा हुआ था कि वह जल्द ही रोना शुरू कर दिया था मैं यह नहीं चाहता लेकिन खाना वास्तव में अच्छा है। यहाँ कुछ सुनहरे आलू आज़माएँ, जो वास्तव में अच्छे हैं और आप मुझसे शादी करने के बाद। आपको यह सब खाना होगा, मुझे लगा कि आपको फैंसी चीजें पसंद हैं नहीं, मैं आपसे शादी नहीं करना चाहता। मेरी माँ ने मुझे घर जाने दिया और मेलिस्सा ने एक दूसरे को देखा और अच्छी तरह से झांका। अगर तुम सच में चाहते हो तो मैं तुम्हें घर ले जाऊँगा, रोने और दुखी हो गया। गाड़ी में घर पर नशीली चीजें, जो उसने घर पहुंचते ही बनाई थी, के बारे में गहराई से सोचना शुरू कर दिया। वह अपनी माँ को गले लगाने के लिए दौड़ी, जो न तो घर में उदास बैठी थी और न ही बहन ओ मेरी प्यारी बेटी ने सोचा था कि मैं तुम्हें फिर कभी नहीं देख पाऊँगी। ओह मॉम आई लव यू सो मच और आप सही लग रहे थे और धन नहीं है सब कुछ सोने की रोटी बेकार थी क्योंकि मैं इसे और आदमी को खा नहीं सकता था। वह हैंडसम था, उसने मेरी बिल्कुल भी परवाह नहीं की, लेकिन मेरे प्यारे, क्या आपको पता है कि आपने दूसरों के साथ वैसा ही व्यवहार किया है, मुझे पता है कि जिस तरह से मैंने देखा है, ठीक उसी तरह से मैंने माँ के अभिनय के लिए खेद जताया है। आपकी गलती क्या थी आइए आपको उस दिन से कुछ अच्छा खिलाते हैं। narcisa ने अपने तरीके बदल दिए जिससे वह पहले तो संघर्ष करती रही लेकिन धीरे-धीरे और धैर्य से वह एक दिन बहुत अच्छी बनने लगी और एक दिन टेरी फिर से मियां से मिलने आई ओह हेल्लो तुम दो तो हमें मियां बताओ। किस तरह' s narcissism अब marian ने उन दोनों को वह सब कुछ बताया जो हुआ था और वह उस समय से बहुत बदल गया है। क्या मुझे लगता है कि वह अब और कोई सोने की रोटी नहीं चाहती है। टेरी आप वास्तव में उस परी की तरह थोड़ी दिखती हैं, हालांकि मैं क्या देख रही हूं कि आप कैसे हो सकते हैं कि आप दो इतने अच्छे हैं",Hindi

"ஓ அம்மா நான் உன்னை மிகவும் நேசிக்கிறேன், நீ சரியான தோற்றம் மற்றும் செல்வம் எல்லாம் தங்க ரொட்டி பயனற்றது என்பதால் என்னால் அதை சாப்பிட முடியவில்லை, மனிதனும் கூட.",Tamil
"அவர் அழகாக இருந்தார், அவர் என்னைப் பொருட்படுத்தவில்லை, ஆனால் என் அன்பே நீங்கள் மற்றவர்களிடம் நடந்துகொண்டது இதுதான் என்று எனக்குத் தெரியும், எனக்குத் தெரியும், நான் அம்மாவாக நடித்த விதத்தில் மிகவும் வருந்துகிறேன், இல்லை, நீங்கள் பார்த்ததிலிருந்து இது சரி.",Tamil

[3] A Nature tem um público on-line de cerca de 3 milhões de leitores únicos por mês.,Portugeese
"[4] A revista tem uma circulação semanal de cerca de 53 mil exemplares, mas estudos concluíram que, em média, uma única cópia é compartilhada por até oito pessoas.",Portugeese
"[5] Os cientistas da pesquisa são o público principal da revista, mas resumos e artigos de acompanhamento destinam-se a fazer muitos dos estudos importantes mais compreensíveis para cientistas de outras áreas e para o público educado.",Portugeese
"Em cada edição há editoriais, notícias e artigos sobre questões de interesse geral para cientistas, incluindo assuntos atuais, o financiamento da ciência, negócios, ética científica e descobertas de pesquisa.",Portugeese
"Há muitas áreas de investigação em que novos e importantes avanços e pesquisas originais são publicados, tanto como artigos quanto como cartas.",Portugeese
Os trabalhos que foram publicados nesta revista são internacionalmente aclamados pela manutenção de altos padrões de pesquisa.,Portugeese
"Em 2007, a Nature (em conjunto com a Science) recebeu o Prêmio Princesa das Astúrias de Comunicação e Humanidade.",Portugeese
"[6][7] No dia 14 de dezembro de 2005, a revista Nature publicou um artigo sobre a Wikipédia a respeito de uma pesquisa feita comparando alguns de seus artigos com os da enciclopédia Britânica em áreas científicas quanto à quantidade de erros encontrados.",Portugeese
"[8] A Wikipédia é um projeto de enciclopédia multilíngue de licença livre,[5][6] baseado na web e escrito de maneira colaborativa.",Portugeese
"[6] O projeto encontra-se sob administração da Fundação Wikimedia,[7] uma organização sem fins lucrativos cuja missão é ""empoderar e engajar pessoas pelo mundo para coletar e desenvolver conteúdo educacional sob uma licença livre ou no domínio público, e para disseminá-lo efetivamente e globalmente"".",Portugeese
"[8] Integrando um dos vários projetos[5] mantidos pela Wikimedia, os mais de 51 milhões de artigos (1 054 034 em português, até 29 de janeiro de 2021) hoje encontrados na Wikipédia foram escritos de forma conjunta por diversos voluntários ao redor do mundo.",Portugeese
Quase todos os verbetes presentes no sítio eletrônico podem igualmente ser editados por qualquer pessoa com acesso à internet e ao endereço eletrônico.,Portugeese
"[nota 2] Em janeiro de 2020, havia edições ativas da Wikipédia em 299 idiomas.",Portugeese
"A Wikipédia foi lançada em 15 de janeiro de 2001 por Jimmy Wales e Larry Sanger[9] e tornou-se a maior e mais popular obra de referência geral na internet,[1][10][11][12] sendo classificada em novembro de 2018, na quinta posição entre todos os websites do Alexa.",Portugeese
"[10] Em 2010, tinha cerca de 365 milhões de leitores.",Portugeese
"[13] A Wikipédia é uma ferramenta de pesquisa amplamente utilizada por estudantes e tem influenciado o trabalho de publicitários, pedagogos, sociólogos e jornalistas, que usam seu material, mesmo que nem sempre citem suas fontes.",Portugeese
"[14] O nome Wikipedia foi criado por Larry Sanger[15] e é uma combinação de wiki (uma tecnologia para criar sites colaborativos, a partir da palavra havaiana wiki, que significa ""rápido"") e enciclopédia.",Portugeese
"A palavra ""Wikipédia"" é uma adequação lusófona da forma original anglófona sobre a fusão dos dois nomes que formam o termo.",Portugeese
"Em português, o prefixo ""Wiki"" é somado ao sufixo de ""enciclopédia"", ganhando acento diacrítico agudo no e, para atender à gramática lusófona.",Portugeese
"A Wikipédia afasta-se do estilo tradicional de construção de uma enciclopédia, possuindo uma grande presença de conteúdo não acadêmico.",Portugeese
"Quando a revista Time reconheceu ""Você"" como a Pessoa do Ano de 2006, devido ao sucesso acelerado da colaboração online e da interação de milhões de usuários ao redor do mundo, citou a Wikipédia como um dos vários exemplos de serviços da Web 2.0, juntamente com YouTube, MySpace e Facebook.",Portugeese
"[16] A importância da Wikipédia tem sido notada não apenas como uma referência enciclopédica, mas também como um recurso de notícias atualizado com frequência, por conta da rapidez com que artigos sobre acontecimentos recentes aparecem.",Portugeese
[17][18] Estudantes têm sido orientados a escrever artigos para a Wikipédia como um exercício de explicar de forma clara e sucinta conceitos difíceis para um público não iniciado.,Portugeese
"[19] Embora as políticas da Wikipédia defendam fortemente a verificabilidade e um ponto de vista neutro, seus críticos acusam-na de viés sistêmico e inconsistências (incluindo o peso excessivo dado à cultura de massa)[20] e alegam que ela favorece o consenso sobre credenciais em seus processos editoriais.",Portugeese
[21] Sua confiabilidade e precisão também são alvo de críticas.,Portugeese
[22] Outras críticas apontam a sua suscetibilidade ao vandalismo e à adição de informações falsas ou não verificadas.,Portugeese
"[23] No entanto, trabalhos acadêmicos sugerem que os vandalismos são geralmente de curta duração.",Portugeese
"[24][25] Uma pesquisa de 2005 na revista Nature mostrou que os artigos científicos que eles compararam chegavam perto do nível de precisão da Encyclopædia Britannica e tinham uma taxa semelhante de ""erros graves"".",Portugeese
"[26] Outra pesquisa de 2011 realizada pelo ForeSee Results e divulgada pela CNET mostrou que, em uma escala de satisfação de 0 a 100, os internautas atribuíram 78 pontos à Wikipédia, um resultado maior que o de outros sites consagrados, como YouTube e Facebook.",Portugeese
"[27] A Wikipédia começou como um projeto complementar para a Nupedia, um projeto de enciclopédia online gratuita de língua inglesa, cujos artigos eram escritos por especialistas e revistos em um processo formal.",Portugeese
"[28] A Nupedia foi fundada em 9 de março de 2000, sob a posse da Bomis, uma empresa de portal web.",Portugeese
"Suas principais figuras eram Jimmy Wales, CEO da Bomis, e Larry Sanger, editor-chefe da Nupedia e posteriormente da Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"A Nupedia foi licenciada inicialmente sob sua própria licença de conteúdo aberto, a mudança para a GNU Free Documentation License aconteceu antes da fundação da Wikipédia, a pedido de Richard Stallman.",Portugeese
[29] Larry Sanger e Jimmy Wales fundaram a Wikipédia.,Portugeese
"[30][31] Embora Wales seja creditado por definir o objetivo de fazer uma enciclopédia editável publicamente,[32][33] Sanger é geralmente creditado pela estratégia de usar um wiki para alcançar esse objetivo.",Portugeese
"[34] Em 10 de janeiro de 2001, Larry Sanger propôs na lista de discussão da Nupedia a criação de um wiki como um projeto ""alimentador"" para a Nupedia.",Portugeese
"[35] A Wikipédia foi formalmente lançada em 15 de janeiro de 2001, como uma única edição em inglês em www.wikipedia.com[36] e anunciada por Sanger na lista de discussão da Nupedia.",Portugeese
"[32] A política do ""ponto de vista neutro"" da Wikipédia""[nota 3] foi codificada em seus meses iniciais e era semelhante à política anterior da Nupedia de ""não-parcialidade"".",Portugeese
"Por outro lado, inicialmente havia relativamente poucas regras e a Wikipédia operava independentemente da Nupedia.",Portugeese
"[32] A Wikipédia ganhou os primeiros colaboradores da Nupedia, de postagens no Slashdot e indexação do motor de busca na web.",Portugeese
"Até o final de 2001, o site já havia crescido para cerca de 20 000 artigos em 18 idiomas.",Portugeese
"No final de 2002, tinha alcançado 26 edições em idiomas diferentes, 46 até o final de 2003 e 161 nos últimos dias de 2004.",Portugeese
A Nupedia e a Wikipédia coexistiram até os servidores da primeira serem retirados de forma permanente em 2003 e seu texto incorporado na Wikipédia.,Portugeese
"A Wikipédia em inglês passou a marca dos dois milhões de artigos em 9 de setembro de 2007, tornando-a a maior enciclopédia já construída, superando até mesmo a Enciclopédia Yung-lo Ta-tien (1407), que detinha esse recorde desde há exatamente 600 anos.",Portugeese
"[37] Citando temores de publicidade comercial ser inserida no site e a falta de controle numa Wikipédia que viam como sendo anglo-cêntrica, usuários da Wikipédia em espanhol criaram uma versão independente da Wikipédia em fevereiro de 2002, a Enciclopedia Libre.",Portugeese
"[38] Mais tarde naquele ano, Wales anunciou que a Wikipédia não iria exibir anúncios publicitários e seu site foi movido para wikipedia.org.",Portugeese
"[39] Vários outros projetos de wiki-enciclopédias foram iniciados, em grande parte sob uma filosofia diferente do modelo editorial aberto e baseado no chamado ""princípio da imparcialidade"" da Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"O Wikinfo, por exemplo, não requer um ponto de vista neutro e permite pesquisas originais.",Portugeese
"Novos projetos inspirados na Wikipédia — como o Citizendium, Scholarpedia, Conservapedia e o Knol, da Google, onde os artigos são um pouco mais ensaísticos[40] — foram iniciados para tratar de limitações de percepção da Wikipédia, como suas políticas sobre revisão por pares, pesquisa original e publicidade comercial.",Portugeese
"Embora a Wikipédia em inglês tenha chegado aos três milhões de artigos em agosto de 2009, o crescimento de edições, em termos de números de artigos e de colaboradores, parece ter estabilizado em torno do início de 2007.",Portugeese
"[41] Em 2006, cerca de 1 800 artigos foram adicionados diariamente à enciclopédia; até 2010 essa média era de cerca de 1 000.",Portugeese
[42] A equipe do Palo Alto Research Center especulou que isso se deve ao aumento da exclusividade do projeto.,Portugeese
"[43] Editores novos ou ocasionais têm taxas significativamente mais altas de suas edições revertidas (removidas) do que um grupo de elite de editores regulares, coloquialmente conhecido como a ""panela"".",Portugeese
"Isso poderá estar a tornar mais difícil para o projeto recrutar e reter novos colaboradores a longo prazo, resultando na estagnação da criação de novos artigos.",Portugeese
"Outros sugerem que o crescimento está a nivelar naturalmente, pois os artigos mais básicos já existem.",Portugeese
"[44][45] Em novembro de 2009, uma tese de doutorado escrita por Felipe Ortega, um pesquisador da Universidade Rey Juan Carlos em Madrid, revelou que a Wikipédia em inglês havia perdido 49 000 editores nos primeiros três meses de 2009, enquanto que durante o mesmo período em 2008 o mesmo projeto perdeu apenas 4 900 editores.",Portugeese
"[46][47] O The Wall Street Journal relatou que ""um número sem precedentes de milhões de voluntários online que escrevem, editam e policiam a Wikipédia está desistindo.""",Portugeese
Entre as razões citadas no artigo para esta tendência encontram-se a matriz de regras aplicadas à edição e disputas relacionadas a tais conteúdos.,Portugeese
"[48] Estas alegações foram contestadas por Jimmy Wales, que negou o declínio e questionou a metodologia do estudo.",Portugeese
"[49] Em janeiro de 2007, a Wikipédia entrou na lista dos dez sites mais populares nos Estados Unidos, segundo a comScore Networks Inc. Com 42,9 milhões de visitantes únicos e o nono lugar, a Wikipédia superou os sites do The New York Times (10.º) e Apple Inc. (11.º).",Portugeese
"Foi um aumento significativo em relação a janeiro de 2006, quando o site estava posicionado no 33.º lugar, com apenas 18,3 milhões de visitantes únicos.",Portugeese
"[50] Em abril de 2011, a Wikipédia foi listada como o quinto site mais popular do mundo pela Google Inc.[51][52] Fundação – final de 2001 6 de dezembro de 2001 – 2003 13 de outubro de 2003 – 13 de maio de 2010 Logo atual Afastando-se do estilo das enciclopédias tradicionais, a Wikipédia emprega um sistema aberto, um modelo de edição ""wiki"".",Portugeese
"Exceto por algumas páginas particularmente propensas ao vandalismo, cada artigo pode ser editado de forma anônima ou com uma conta de usuário.",Portugeese
"Edições em diferentes idiomas modificam esta política, por exemplo, na edição em inglês apenas os utilizadores registados podem criar um novo artigo.",Portugeese
"Nenhum artigo ou o seu conteúdo é propriedade do seu criador ou de qualquer outro editor, ou é avaliado por qualquer autoridade reconhecida; ao contrário, os conteúdos são acordados por consenso.",Portugeese
"Por padrão, qualquer edição em um artigo se torna disponível imediatamente, antes de qualquer revisão.",Portugeese
"Isto significa que um artigo pode conter erros, contribuições equivocadas, defesa de algo, ou mesmo absurdos evidentes, até que outro editor corrija o problema.",Portugeese
"Edições em diferentes idiomas, cada uma sob controle administrativo separado, são livres para modificar esta política.",Portugeese
"Por exemplo, a Wikipédia em alemão mantém um sistema de ""versões estáveis"" de artigos, para permitir que um leitor veja as versões dos artigos que passaram por certas revisões.",Portugeese
"[54] Em junho de 2010, os administradores anunciaram que a Wikipédia em inglês eliminaria as restrições de edição estritas de artigos ""controversos"" ou propensos a vandalismo (como George W. Bush, David Cameron, ou lição de casa) usando revisões.",Portugeese
"[55] No lugar de proibir edições de usuários novos ou não registrados, haveria um ""novo sistema, chamado de 'alterações pendentes'"" que, como Jimmy Wales disse à BBC, permitiria à Wikipédia em inglês ""liberar os artigos que foram protegidos ou semiprotegidos por anos para a edição geral.""",Portugeese
"O sistema de ""alterações pendentes"" foi introduzido em 15 de junho de 2010, pouco depois das 23 horas no Tempo Médio de Greenwich (GMT).",Portugeese
"Edições em artigos especificados são agora ""sujeitas a revisão de um editor estabelecido da Wikipédia antes da publicação.""",Portugeese
"Wales opôs-se ao modelo da Wikipédia em alemão de exigir revisão do editor antes de edições em qualquer artigo, descrevendo-o como ""desnecessário e indesejável.""",Portugeese
"Ele acrescentou que os administradores da Wikipédia em alemão irão ""acompanhar de perto o sistema da versão inglesa e tenho certeza que eles vão, pelo menos, considerar a mudança se os resultados forem bons.",Portugeese
"""[56] Contribuintes, registrados ou não, podem tirar proveito dos recursos disponíveis no software que opera a Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"A página ""Ver histórico"" que acompanha cada artigo, regista toda e qualquer versão anterior do verbete, embora uma revisão com conteúdo calunioso, ameaças criminosas ou violações de direitos autorais possam ser removidas mais tarde.",Portugeese
"[57] [nota 4] Esta característica torna mais fácil comparar antigas e novas versões do artigo, desfazer alterações que um editor considera indesejáveis, ou restaurar um conteúdo perdido.",Portugeese
"A página ""Discussão"", associada a cada artigo, é utilizada para coordenar o trabalho entre vários editores.",Portugeese
"[58] Editores regulares muitas vezes mantêm uma lista de ""páginas vigiadas"" de artigos de interesse para eles, de modo que eles podem facilmente manter o controle sobre todas as alterações recentes nessas páginas.",Portugeese
"Programas de computador chamados ""robôs"" têm sido amplamente utilizados para remover vandalismos logo que eles são feitos,[25] para corrigir erros comuns e questões estilísticas, ou para iniciar artigos, tais como entradas de geografia em um formato padronizado a partir de dados estatísticos.",Portugeese
"Os artigos da Wikipédia estão organizados basicamente de três formas de acordo com: estado de desenvolvimento, o assunto e o nível de acesso necessário para edição.",Portugeese
"O estado mais desenvolvido de artigos é chamado de ""artigos destacados"" (AD): artigos classificados como tal são os que serão apresentados na página principal da Wikipédia.",Portugeese
[59][60][nota 5] O pesquisador Giacomo Poderi descobriu que os artigos tendem a atingir o estatuto de AD através do trabalho intensivo de poucos editores.,Portugeese
"[61] Um ""wikiprojeto"", ou simplesmente ""projeto"", é um lugar ou conjunto de páginas usadas por um grupo de editores para coordenar o trabalho sobre um tópico específico.",Portugeese
As páginas de discussão anexadas a um projeto são muitas vezes usadas para coordenar as mudanças que ocorrem nos artigos relacionados com o projeto.,Portugeese
"[nota 6] A Wikipédia também mantém um manual de estilo chamado de ""livro de estilo"" (LE) para padronizações editoriais acerca dos títulos e organização dos artigos, da formatação e uso de recursos multimídias.",Portugeese
"[nota 7] Por razões legais, o conteúdo na Wikipédia está sujeito às leis (lei de direitos autorais em particular) da Flórida, onde os servidores da Wikipédia estão hospedados.",Portugeese
"Além disso, os princípios editoriais da Wikipédia são dispostos nos chamados ""cinco pilares"" e em numerosas políticas e diretrizes que destinam-se a moldar o conteúdo de forma adequada.",Portugeese
"[nota 8] Até mesmo essas regras são armazenadas em forma de wiki e os editores da Wikipédia, como uma comunidade, podem escrever e revisar as políticas e diretrizes[62] e aplicá-las por exclusão, marcando com etiquetas (tags), ou modificando o conteúdo dos artigos para deixá-los de acordo com tais regulamentações.",Portugeese
"[63] De acordo com as regras da Wikipédia, só os temas considerados ""enciclopédicos"" são dignos de ter verbete na Wikipédia, e esse verbete não deve ser redigido como um verbete de dicionário.",Portugeese
"Os temas dos artigos devem também atender aos padrões de ""notoriedade"" da Wikipédia, o que normalmente significa que ele deve ter recebido uma cobertura significativa em fontes secundárias confiáveis, tais como a mídia ou grandes revistas acadêmicas que são independentes do assunto do tópico.",Portugeese
"Além disso, a Wikipédia deve expor o conhecimento que já está estabelecido e reconhecido.",Portugeese
"Em outras palavras, não deve apresentar, por exemplo, novas informações ou obras originais.",Portugeese
Uma alegação que é suscetível de ser questionada requer pelo menos uma referência a uma fonte confiável.,Portugeese
"Entre os editores da Wikipédia, isto é frequentemente descrito como ""comprovação, não a verdade"", para expressar a ideia de que os leitores, e não a enciclopédia, são responsáveis por verificar a veracidade dos artigos e fazer as suas próprias interpretações.",Portugeese
"Finalmente, a Wikipédia não deve tomar partido.",Portugeese
"Todas as opiniões e pontos de vista, se imputáveis a fontes externas, deverão ser adequadamente cobertos pelo texto do artigo.",Portugeese
[64] A Wikipédia tem muitos métodos de resolução de litígios.,Portugeese
"O ciclo ""seja audaz, reverta, discuta"" ocorre algumas vezes, quando um usuário faz uma edição, outro usuário reverte essa edição e o assunto é discutido na página de discussão apropriada.",Portugeese
"Com o fim de obter um consenso mais amplo da comunidade, as questões podem ser levantadas na ""Esplanada"" ou nos ""Pedidos de opinião"", locais em que é solicitada a participação de outros usuários na discussão.",Portugeese
"Existem fóruns especializados que centralizam as discussões de decisões específicas, como por exemplo, se um artigo deve ou não ser eliminado.",Portugeese
"A mediação é por vezes utilizada, embora tenha sido considerada por alguns wikipedistas inútil na resolução de disputas particularmente controversas.",Portugeese
"Análises estatísticas sugerem que a resolução de disputas na Wikipédia ignora o conteúdo das disputas de usuários e centra-se, ao invés disso, na conduta do usuário, funcionando não tanto para resolver disputas e promover a paz entre os usuários conflitantes, mas para eliminar usuários problemáticos enquanto os usuários potencialmente produtivos voltam a participar.",Portugeese
"Suas soluções incluem o banimento de usuários da Wikipédia (usado em 15,7% dos casos), soluções em relação ao assunto (23,4%), bloqueio de artigos (43,3%) e avisos e penalidades (63,2%).",Portugeese
"[nota 9] Entretanto, nem todas as versões da Wikipédia possuem um ArbCom, sendo esta uma ferramenta opcional.",Portugeese
Proibições totais de edição na Wikipédia são em grande parte limitadas aos casos de personificação falsa e comportamento antissocial.,Portugeese
Tendem a ser emitidos mais avisos para problemas na conduta de edição e condutas anticonsenso do que para condutas antissociais.,Portugeese
"[65] Todo o texto contido na Wikipédia era coberto pela GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), uma licença copyleft que permite a redistribuição, a criação de obras derivadas e o uso comercial do conteúdo preservando os direitos autorais dos autores, até junho de 2009, quando foi adotada a licença Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) 3.0.",Portugeese
"[66] A Wikipédia tem trabalhado na mudança para as Licenças Creative Commons porque a GFDL, inicialmente projetada para manuais de software, não foi considerada adequada para obras de referência online e porque as duas licenças eram incompatíveis.",Portugeese
"[67] Em resposta ao pedido da Fundação Wikimedia, em novembro de 2008, a Free Software Foundation (FSF) lançou uma nova versão da GFDL concebida especificamente para permitir à Wikipédia relicenciar seu conteúdo para CC-BY-SA em 1 de agosto de 2009.",Portugeese
A Wikipédia e seus projetos irmãos realizaram um referendo em toda a comunidade para decidir se devia ou não fazer a troca da licença.,Portugeese
O referendo ocorreu entre 9 e 30 de abril.,Portugeese
"Os resultados foram 75,8% ""sim"", 10,5% ""não"" e 13,7% ""sem opinião"".",Portugeese
"Em consequência do referendo, o Conselho Diretivo da Wikimedia votou para mudar para a licença Creative Commons.",Portugeese
A mudança foi efetivada em 15 de junho de 2009.,Portugeese
A posição de que a Wikipédia é apenas um serviço de hospedagem tem sido utilizada com sucesso como uma defesa em tribunal.,Portugeese
"[68][69] A utilização de arquivos de mídia (por exemplo, arquivos de imagem) varia entre as várias edições em diferentes idiomas.",Portugeese
"Algumas edições da Wikipédia, como a Wikipédia em inglês, incluem arquivos de imagem não livres sob a doutrina do fair use (em português: uso justo), enquanto outras optaram por não o fazer, em parte, por causa das diferenças nas leis de direitos autorais dos vários países — por exemplo, a noção de fair use não existe na lei de direitos autorais japonesa.",Portugeese
"Arquivos de mídia cobertos por licenças de conteúdo livre (por exemplo, CC-BY-SA) são compartilhados entre as diferentes edições da Wikipédia através do repositório Wikimedia Commons, um projeto também operado pela Fundação Wikimedia.",Portugeese
"Como o conteúdo da Wikipédia é distribuído sob uma licença aberta, qualquer um pode reutilizar ou redistribuí-lo sem nenhum custo.",Portugeese
"O conteúdo da Wikipédia é publicado fora do site Wikipédia em muitas formas, tanto online como offline.",Portugeese
"Obter o conteúdo completo da Wikipédia para reutilização apresenta desafios, uma vez que a cópia direta através de um web crawler é desencorajada.",Portugeese
"[78] A Wikipédia publica ""dumps"" de seu conteúdo, mas estes consistem apenas de texto; em 2007 não havia dumps disponíveis de imagens da Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"[79] A Wikipédia pretende criar um resumo de todo o conhecimento humano na forma de uma enciclopédia online, com cada tópico do conhecimento coberto enciclopedicamente por um artigo.",Portugeese
"Uma vez que tem espaço em disco praticamente ilimitado, o site pode conter muito mais temas do que podem ser cobertos por qualquer enciclopédia impressa convencional.",Portugeese
"[nota 12] Além disso, contém materiais que algumas pessoas podem achar censuráveis, ofensivos ou pornográficos.",Portugeese
"Foi esclarecido que esta política não está em debate, mas ela tem-se revelado controversa.",Portugeese
"Por exemplo, em 2008, a Wikipédia rejeitou uma petição online contra a inclusão de representações de Maomé em sua edição em inglês, citando esta política.",Portugeese
A presença de materiais politicamente sensíveis na Wikipédia também levou a República Popular da China a bloquear o acesso a partes do site.,Portugeese
"[81] Em setembro de 2009, os artigos da Wikipédia cobriam cerca de meio milhão de lugares na Terra.",Portugeese
"No entanto, uma pesquisa realizada pelo Oxford Internet Institute mostrou que a distribuição geográfica dos artigos de todas as versões da Wikipédia é muito desigual.",Portugeese
"A maioria dos artigos são escritos sobre a América do Norte, Europa e Ásia Oriental, com muito pouca cobertura de grandes partes do mundo em desenvolvimento, incluindo a maior parte da África.",Portugeese
"[82] Um estudo de 2008 conduzido por pesquisadores da Universidade Carnegie Mellon e do Palo Alto Research Center apresentou uma distribuição de temas, bem como o crescimento (de julho de 2006 a janeiro de 2008) em cada campo relativos à Wikipédia em inglês:[80] No entanto, deve-se considerar que estes números dizem apenas respeito aos artigos, é possível que um tópico contenha uma série de artigos curtos e outro artigos muito grandes.",Portugeese
"Além disso, a cobertura exata da Wikipédia está sob constante revisão pelos editores e desacordos não são incomuns (ver também delecionismo e inclusionismo).",Portugeese
"[83][84] A comunidade da Wikipédia tem sido descrita como ""cult"",[85] (embora nem sempre com uma conotação totalmente negativa)[86] e criticada por não acomodar os usuários inexperientes.",Portugeese
"[87] A comunidade Wikipédia estabeleceu ""uma espécie de burocracia"", incluindo ""uma clara estrutura de poder que dá aos administradores voluntários a autoridade para exercer o controle editorial.",Portugeese
"""[88][89][90] Editores com boa reputação na comunidade podem ser nomeados para um dos vários níveis de gestão de voluntários, como os autorrevisores (cujas edições são marcadas automaticamente como confiáveis), reversores (para os quais são simplificadas as ações que desfazem edições), eliminadores (que podem eliminar páginas) e administradores (englobando todos os outros, além de poderem bloquear alterações em artigos em caso de vandalismo ou de disputas editoriais e bloquear contas de usuários).",Portugeese
"Apesar do nome, os administradores não desfrutam de qualquer privilégio especial na tomada de decisões; em vez disso eles limitam-se, na sua maioria, a fazer edições que têm efeitos em todo o projeto e que, portanto, não são permitidas aos editores comuns, e a impedir usuários de fazerem edições disruptivas (como o vandalismo).",Portugeese
"Páginas e verbetes podem ser apagados por usuários que possuem os cargos de eliminador ou administrador, através de votações ou por eliminação rápida, quando descumprem alguma política do site.",Portugeese
Burocratas e verificadores são dois outros cargos que podem ser atribuídos a editores.,Portugeese
[91] A Wikipédia não exige que seus usuários forneçam a sua identificação.,Portugeese
"[92] No entanto, como a Wikipédia cresce através do seu modelo não convencional de construção de enciclopédia, ""Quem escreve a Wikipédia?""",Portugeese
"tornou-se uma das perguntas mais frequentes sobre o projeto, muitas vezes com uma referência para outros projetos de Web 2.0 como o Digg.",Portugeese
"[93] Jimmy Wales afirmou certa vez que apenas ""uma comunidade... um grupo dedicado de algumas centenas de voluntários"" faz a maior parte das contribuições para a Wikipédia e que o projeto é, portanto, ""como qualquer organização tradicional.""",Portugeese
"Wales realizou um estudo onde constatou que mais de 50% de todas as edições são feitas por apenas 0,7% dos usuários (ou seja, 524 pessoas em 2006, ano da pesquisa).",Portugeese
"Este método de avaliação de contribuições foi posteriormente contestada por Aaron Swartz, que observou que vários artigos de uma amostragem que efetuou tinham grande parte do seu conteúdo (medida pelo número de caracteres) contribuído por usuários com baixas contagens de edições.",Portugeese
"[94] Um estudo de 2007 realizado por pesquisadores da Faculdade de Dartmouth descobriu que ""colaboradores anônimos e pouco frequentes na Wikipédia são confiáveis e uma fonte de conhecimento tanto quanto os contribuintes que se inscrevem no site.",Portugeese
"""[95] Embora alguns contribuintes sejam autoridades em suas áreas, a Wikipédia exige que mesmo os seus contributos sejam apoiados por publicações e fontes verificáveis.",Portugeese
"A preferência do projeto pelo consenso sobre credenciais foi rotulada como ""anti-elitismo"".",Portugeese
"[20] Em um estudo de 2003 sobre a comunidade da Wikipédia, a doutoranda em economia Andrea Ciffolilli argumentou que os baixos custos de transação de participar de software wiki criaram um catalisador para o desenvolvimento colaborativo e que uma abordagem de  ""construção criativa"" incentiva a participação.",Portugeese
"[96] Em seu livro 2008, O Futuro da Internet e Como Pará-lo, Jonathan Zittrain, do Oxford Internet Institute e do Berkman Center for Internet & Society, pertencente à Harvard Law School, cita o sucesso da Wikipédia como um caso de como a colaboração aberta tem fomentado a inovação na web.",Portugeese
"[97] Um estudo de 2008 revelou que usuários da Wikipédia eram menos agradáveis e abertos, embora mais conscientes, que os não-usuários da Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"[98][99] Um estudo de 2009 sugeriu que havia ""indícios de uma crescente resistência da comunidade da Wikipédia a novos conteúdos.",Portugeese
"""[100] Na OOPSLA de 2009, o CTO da Wikimedia Brion Vibber fez uma apresentação intitulada ""Otimização de Desempenho da Comunidade: Fazendo a sua Equipe Funcionar Tão Bem Quanto o Seu Site"" em que discutiu os desafios de lidar com as contribuições de uma grande comunidade e comparou o processo com o de desenvolvimento de softwares.",Portugeese
"[101] O The New York Times publicou uma coluna com uma pesquisa sobre a Wikipédia no momento do seu décimo aniversário citando que, ""... Wikimedia Foundation colaborou em um estudo da base contribuinte da Wikipédia e descobriu que ela era composta por apenas 13% de mulheres e a média de idade de um contribuinte estava entre os 20 e 30 anos, de acordo com o estudo conjunto de um centro da Universidade das Nações Unidas e da Universidade de Maastricht"", e também observa que ""as pesquisas sugerem que menos de 15% de suas centenas de milhares de colaboradores são mulheres.""",Portugeese
"A meta estabelecida por Sue Gardner, diretora executiva da Fundação Wikimedia, é ver as contribuições femininas aumentarem para 25% até 2015.",Portugeese
"[102] Membros da comunidade predominantemente interagem uns com os outros através das páginas de ""discussão"", que são páginas wiki-editáveis que estão associadas com os artigos, bem como através de páginas de discussão que são específicas para editores em particular e páginas de discussão que ajudam a gerir o site.",Portugeese
"Essas páginas ajudam os contribuintes a chegarem a um consenso sobre o que o conteúdo dos artigos deve constar, sobre quais regras do site podem mudar e tomar medidas com relação a qualquer problema dentro da comunidade.",Portugeese
"A Esplanada é o principal local de interação entre os usuários após as páginas de discussão; nela é possível fazer anúncios, perguntas e propostas de alterações nas políticas do projeto.",Portugeese
"Os wikipedistas recebem, por vezes, prêmios ou medalhas por seu bom trabalho, uma espécie de reforço positivo na forma de fichas personalizadas de apreço.",Portugeese
"Estas fichas revelam uma ampla gama de trabalho valorizado, indo muito além de simples edições para incluir suporte social, ações administrativas e os tipos de trabalho de articulação.",Portugeese
O fenômeno de medalhas foi analisado por pesquisadores que procuram determinar como isso poderia ter implicações em outras comunidades envolvidas em contribuições de larga escala.,Portugeese
[103] 60% dos usuários registrados nunca fazem outra edição após as suas primeiras 24 horas.,Portugeese
Possíveis explicações para esse fenômeno são que tais usuários só se inscrevem para uma única finalidade ou são assustados por suas experiências.,Portugeese
"[104] Goldman escreve que os editores que não cumprem os rituais culturais da Wikipédia, como a assinatura de páginas de discussão, implicitamente dão sinais de que eles são estranhos na comunidade, aumentando as chances de que usuários experientes da Wikipédia tenham como alvo as suas contribuições.",Portugeese
"Tornar-se um editor experiente da Wikipédia envolve desafios não triviais: o contribuinte deverá construir uma página de usuário, aprender os códigos tecnológicos específicos da Wikipédia, submeter-se a um processo misterioso de resolução de disputas e aprender uma cultura ""desconcertantemente rica em piadas internas e referências privilegiadas.""",Portugeese
"Usuários não registrados são, em algum sentido, cidadãos de segunda classe na Wikipédia,[105] visto que os ""participantes são credenciados por membros da comunidade wiki, que têm interesse em preservar a qualidade do produto do trabalho, com base em sua participação em curso,""[106] mas as contribuições de endereços de IP podem não necessariamente serem creditadas a um usuário em particular.",Portugeese
"Um estudo de 2009 realizado por Henry Blodget mostrou que uma amostra aleatória de grandes artigos na Wikipédia (medido pela quantidade de texto que sobreviveu na última edição da amostra) foi criada por novatos ou anônimos (usuários com baixas contagens de edições), enquanto a maioria da edição e formatação é feita por usuários experientes (um grupo selecionado de usuários estabelecidos).",Portugeese
"[107] Em janeiro de 2020 havia 277 versões ativas da Wikipédia em diferentes idiomas, das quais 16 possuíam mais de um milhão de artigos e 43 tinham mais de 200 000 artigos.",Portugeese
"[nota 1]De acordo com o Alexa, o subdomínio anglófono recebe 56,7% do tráfego acumulado da Wikipédia, com o restante dividido entre as outras línguas (seguido do em espanhol: 8%, em japonês: 7,8%, em russo: 5,8%, em alemão: 4,3%).",Portugeese
"[1] A Wikipédia em inglês possui o maior número de artigos (cerca de 6 milhões), a alemã e a francesa possuem mais de 2 milhões, a francesa, a castelhana, a italiana e a russa possuem mais 1,5 milhão de artigos cada, sendo essas as wikipédias com maior número de edições.",Portugeese
"[nota 1] Uma vez que a Wikipédia é um projeto livre da internet no mundo inteiro, portanto, os colaboradores de uma edição podem vir de lugares diferentes e por isso usarem dialetos diferentes (como é o caso da Wikipédia em português).",Portugeese
"Estas diferenças podem levar a alguns conflitos sobre diferenças de grafia (por exemplo trem ou comboio, goleiro ou guarda-redes) ou pontos de vista.",Portugeese
"Embora nas várias edições de idiomas sejam mantidas as políticas mundiais, da Wikimedia Foundation, como o ""ponto de vista neutro"", elas divergem em alguns pontos do texto e da prática, principalmente em imagens sem licença livre poderem ou não ser utilizadas sob uma alegação de fair use.",Portugeese
"[108] Jimmy Wales descreveu a Wikipédia como ""um esforço para criar e distribuir uma enciclopédia livre da mais alta qualidade possível para cada pessoa no planeta em sua própria língua"".",Portugeese
"[109] Embora cada edição possua funções de línguas mais ou menos independentes, alguns esforços estão sendo feitos para supervisionar todos eles.",Portugeese
"Eles são coordenados, em parte, pelo Meta-Wiki e pela Wikimedia Foundation (dedicada à manutenção de todos os seus projetos, Wikipédia e outros).",Portugeese
"Por exemplo, o Meta-Wiki fornece estatísticas importantes em todas as versões da Wikipédia e mantém uma lista dos artigos essenciais, que devem constar em todas as edições do projeto.",Portugeese
"Artigos traduzidos representam apenas uma pequena porção de artigos na maioria das edições, em parte porque a tradução automática de artigos não é permitida.",Portugeese
"Artigos disponíveis em mais de uma língua podem oferecer links chamados de ""Interwikis"", com ligações para o mesmo artigo em outra língua.",Portugeese
"O processo de atualização da Wikipédia não é apenas diário: ocorre a qualquer instante, muitas vezes em tempo real, no tocante a eventos mais importantes.",Portugeese
"Sobre isso, a revista Época salientou: ""O verbete sobre a presidente eleita do Chile, Michelle Bachelet, trazia a notícia sobre a sua vitória nas eleições momentos após o anúncio oficial"".",Portugeese
"[110] É, portanto, uma enciclopédia ""viva"", ""ágil"" e ""pop"".",Portugeese
Os fatores consistência e qualidade são constantemente monitorados por wikipedistas mais ativos.,Portugeese
Um controle especial registra automaticamente a data e hora de cada última atualização.,Portugeese
"Quando surgem erros, o tempo médio atual para suas correções é de dois minutos.",Portugeese
"Graças à colaboração de voluntários, não raro consultores e editores wiki mesclam-se numa só pessoa.",Portugeese
"Como os interesses das pessoas são variadíssimos, o acervo da Wikipédia abrange várias tribos culturais.",Portugeese
[111] A natureza aberta do modelo de edição tem sido o mote da maioria das críticas à Wikipédia.,Portugeese
"Por exemplo, um leitor de um artigo não pode ter certeza de que determinado verbete não foi comprometido pela inserção de informações falsas ou pela remoção de informações essenciais.",Portugeese
"O ex-editor chefe da Encyclopædia Britannica, Robert McHenry, certa vez descreveu isto dizendo:[112] No entanto, o vandalismo óbvio é fácil de remover nos artigos, já que as versões anteriores de cada artigo são mantidas.",Portugeese
"Na prática, o tempo médio para detectar e corrigir vandalismos é muito baixo, normalmente de alguns minutos,[24][25] mas em um incidente particularmente bem divulgado, uma informação falsa foi introduzida na biografia do político estadunidense John Seigenthaler e permaneceu despercebida por quatro meses.",Portugeese
"[114] John Seigenthaler, o diretor editorial fundador do USA Today e fundador do ""Centro Primeira Emenda"" da Universidade Vanderbilt, chamou Jimmy Wales e perguntou-lhe se existia alguma forma de saber quem contribuiu com a desinformação.",Portugeese
"Wales respondeu que não, mas, no entanto, o autor acabou por ser rastreado.",Portugeese
"[115][116] Este incidente levou a mudanças nas políticas no site, especificamente orientadas para o reforço verificabilidade de todos os artigos biográficos de pessoas vivas.",Portugeese
"A estrutura aberta da Wikipédia faz com que ela seja um alvo fácil para os trolls, spams e aqueles procuram usar o projeto para espalhar suas ideias.",Portugeese
"[57][117] A adição de spins políticos para artigos de organizações, incluindo membros da Câmara dos Representantes dos Estados Unidos e grupos de interesses especiais,[23] foi observada,[118] e organizações como a Microsoft têm oferecido incentivos financeiros para trabalhar em certos artigos.",Portugeese
"[119] Estas questões foram parodiadas, nomeadamente por Stephen Colbert no The Colbert Report.",Portugeese
"[120] Por exemplo, em agosto de 2007, o site WikiScanner começou a rastrear as fontes das alterações feitas na Wikipédia por editores anônimos, sem contas registradas no site.",Portugeese
"O programa revelou que muitas dessas edições foram feitas por empresas ou agências do governo para alterar o conteúdo de artigos relacionados a eles, seu pessoal ou seu trabalho.",Portugeese
[121] O WikiScanner pode ajudar a evitar que uma organização ou indivíduos editem páginas que não deveriam.,Portugeese
"A nova ferramenta virtual indica que usuários de computadores da Agência Central de Inteligência (CIA), do Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), do Vaticano, do Partido Trabalhista do Reino Unido, das Organização das Nações Unidas, da Dell Computers, do Walmart, da Microsoft e da Apple,[122] dentre muitos outros, são responsáveis por edições nos textos do site Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"[123] Na prática, a Wikipédia é defendida de ataques por vários sistemas e técnicas.",Portugeese
"Estes incluem páginas onde os usuários podem verificar edições (por exemplo, ""páginas vigiadas"" e ""mudanças recentes""), programas de computador (""bots""), que são cuidadosamente projetados para tentar detectar ataques e corrigi-los automaticamente (ou semi-automaticamente), filtros que avisam os usuários sobre fazer indesejáveis edições, bloqueios sobre a criação de links para sites em particular e bloqueios de edições de contas específicas, endereços de IP ou intervalos de endereços.",Portugeese
"Páginas fortemente atacadas, artigos em particular, podem ser semiprotegidos de modo que apenas usuários registrados estabelecidos possam editá-los, ou para casos particularmente controversos, bloqueios podem ser usados para que apenas os administradores sejam capazes de fazer edições.",Portugeese
"Tal bloqueio é aplicado com moderação, geralmente apenas por curtos períodos de tempo, enquanto os ataques parecerem propensos a continuar.",Portugeese
"Em 8 de agosto de 2014, uma matéria do portal de O Globo[124] afirmou que um dispositivo conectado à internet através da rede sem fio do Palácio do Planalto alterou, em maio de 2013, informações das páginas de Miriam e Carlos Alberto Sardenberg na Wikipédia, com o objetivo de difamá-los.",Portugeese
"As informações inseridas no artigo de Miriam qualificavam suas análises e previsões econômicas como ""desastrosas"", além de acusá-la de ter defendido ""apaixonadamente"" o banqueiro Daniel Dantas quando este foi preso pela Polícia Federal.",Portugeese
[125] Esta última acusação ocorreu em razão de comentário de Miriam na Rádio CBN onde ela defendia a inocência de Dantas.,Portugeese
"[126] As Organizações Globo foram criticadas por divulgar alterações das biografias de seus contratados na Wikipédia, ferramenta de caráter colaborativo e aberta à edição de todos e que, segundo seu próprio criador, Jimmy Wales, não deve ser usada como fonte primária de informação.",Portugeese
[125] Também foram criticadas por só terem noticiado as alterações em plena campanha eleitoral de 2014.,Portugeese
[125] O jornalista Miguel do Rosário divulgou que um usuário que navegava através da rede da Companhia de Processamento de Dados do Estado de São Paulo inseriu uma calúnia na biografia do músico Raul Seixas.,Portugeese
[127] Ele também relatou que já visitou o Palácio do Planalto e que teve acesso à senha da rede sem fio do gabinete presidencial.,Portugeese
"[127] Visto que os contribuintes normalmente reescrevem pequenas porções de um verbete ao invés de fazer grandes revisões em todo o texto, num mesmo artigo pode coexistir conteúdo de alta e de baixa qualidade.",Portugeese
"Os críticos argumentam que, por vezes, edições de não-especialistas minam a qualidade.",Portugeese
"Por exemplo, Roy Rosenzweig, em um ensaio de junho de 2006 que combinou tanto elogios como reparos à Wikipédia, teceu várias críticas à sua prosa e sua incapacidade de distinguir o que de fato é importante do meramente sensacional.",Portugeese
"Ele disse que a Wikipédia é ""surpreendentemente precisa em relatar nomes, datas e acontecimentos da história dos Estados Unidos"" (o campo de estudo de Rosenzweig) e que a maioria dos poucos erros factuais que ele encontrou ""eram pequenos e negligenciáveis"", acrescentando que alguns deles ""simplesmente repetiam crenças divulgadas amplamente, porém imprecisas"", que também são repetidas nas enciclopédias Encarta e na Britannica.",Portugeese
"No entanto, ele fez uma crítica importante: Contrastando o tratamento dado a Abraham Lincoln na Wikipédia com o oferecido na American National Biography Online pelo historiador da Guerra Civil, James McPherson, Rosenzweig disse que ambos eram essencialmente corretos e cobriam os episódios principais da vida de Lincoln, mas elogiou ""a contextualização mais rica de McPherson... seu hábil uso de citações para capturar a voz de Lincoln,... a sua capacidade de transmitir uma mensagem profunda com apenas um punhado de palavras"".",Portugeese
"Por outro lado, ele deu um exemplo de prosa da Wikipédia que considerou ""verborreica e sem graça"".",Portugeese
"Rosenzweig fez ainda uma crítica mais, comparando ""a habilidade e julgamento seguro de um historiador experiente"", exibido por McPherson e outros, com o ""arcaísmo"" da Wikipédia, que ele comparou a esse respeito à revista American Heritage, e disse que embora a Wikipédia forneça frequentemente extensas referências, elas não são as melhores disponíveis.",Portugeese
[128] Rosenzweig também criticou a ambiguidade — encorajada pela política de imparcialidade ou de ponto de vista neutro — significando que é difícil discernir na Wikipédia qualquer orientação interpretativa global da história.,Portugeese
"Por exemplo, ele citou a conclusão do artigo da Wikipédia em inglês sobre William Clarke Quantrill.",Portugeese
"Embora em geral elogiando o artigo, considerou sua conclusão indecisa: ""Alguns historiadores... lembram-se dele como um fora-da-lei oportunista e sedento de sangue, enquanto outros continuam a vê-lo como um soldado audaz e um herói popular.",Portugeese
"""[128] Outros críticos fizeram acusações semelhantes, dizendo que mesmo que os artigos da Wikipédia sejam factualmente precisos, muitas vezes são escritos em um estilo pobre e quase ilegível.",Portugeese
"O frequente crítico da Wikipédia, Andrew Orlowski, comentou: ""Mesmo quando uma página na Wikipédia é 100 por cento correta factualmente, e esses fatos são cuidadosamente escolhidos, muitas vezes o resultado parece como se tivesse sido traduzido de uma língua para outra, em seguida para uma terceira, em todos os estágios passando pelas mãos de tradutores incompetentes.",Portugeese
"""[129] Um estudo de artigos sobre câncer realizado por Yaacov Lawrence do Kimmel Cancer Center, na Universidade Thomas Jefferson, descobriu que os verbetes eram, em sua maioria, precisos, mas eram escritos no nível de leitura da faculdade, ao contrário do nível de colegial visto no Physician Data Query.",Portugeese

"[142] Em junho de 2007, o ex-presidente da American Library Association, Michael Gorman, condenou a Wikipédia, juntamente com o Google,[143] afirmando que os acadêmicos que apoiam o uso da Wikipédia são ""o equivalente intelectual de um nutricionista, que recomenda uma dieta constante de Big Macs com tudo.""",Portugeese
"Ele também disse que ""uma geração de preguiçosos intelectuais incapazes de ir além da Internet"" estava sendo produzida nas universidades.",Portugeese
Ele reclama que as fontes baseadas na web são desanimadoras da aprendizagem dos alunos a partir dos textos mais raros que sejam encontradas apenas no papel ou estão em locais de inscrição somente pela web.,Portugeese
"No mesmo artigo Jenny Fry (um pesquisador do Oxford Internet Institute) comentou sobre acadêmicos que citam a Wikipédia, dizendo que: ""Você não pode dizer que as crianças são intelectualmente preguiçosas porque elas estão usando a Internet, quando os acadêmicos estão usando os motores de busca em suas pesquisas.",Portugeese
A diferença é que eles têm mais experiência para serem críticos sobre o que estão pesquisando e se ele é autoritário.,Portugeese
As crianças precisam ser ensinadas a usar a Internet de forma crítica e adequada.,Portugeese
"""[143] A Wikipédia é uma enciclopédia hospedada e financiada pela Fundação Wikimedia, uma organização sem fins lucrativos que opera a Wikipédia e projetos relacionados, tais como o Wikcionário, Wikilivros e outros.",Portugeese
"Os capítulos Wikimedia, associações locais de usuários e defensores dos projetos Wikimedia, participam também da promoção, desenvolvimento e financiamento do projeto.",Portugeese
"A operação na Wikipédia é realizada através do software wiki livre e de código aberto chamado ""MediaWiki"", o qual é escrito em PHP e usa o banco de dados MySQL.",Portugeese
"O software incorpora recursos de programação como uma macrolinguagem, variáveis, um sistema de transclusão de templates e redirecionamento de URLs.",Portugeese
"O MediaWiki está licenciado sob a GNU General Public License e é usado por todos os projetos da Wikimedia, assim como muitos outros projetos wiki.",Portugeese
"Originalmente, a Wikipédia funcionava com o UseModWiki escrito em Perl por Clifford Adams (primeira fase), que inicialmente requeria hiperligações nos artigos por meio do CamelCase; o estilo atual de faixa dupla só foi incorporado mais tarde.",Portugeese
"[144] A partir de janeiro de 2002 (segunda fase), a Wikipédia passou a contar com um software escrito em PHP wiki, por meio de um banco de dados MySQL, feito sob medida para a Wikipédia por Magnus Manske.",Portugeese
"Nessa fase, o software foi modificado várias vezes, para acomodar a demanda exponencialmente crescente.",Portugeese
"Em julho de 2002, a Wikipédia passou a utilizar um software de terceira geração, o MediaWiki, feito e desenvolvido por Lee Daniel Crocker.",Portugeese
Várias extensões do MediaWiki estão instaladas[145] para estender a funcionalidade deste software.,Portugeese
"Em abril de 2005, uma extensão Apache Lucene foi adicionada ao software MediaWiki em ""bult-in"" e o banco de dados de indexação, que até aí era MySQL, passou a ser do tipo Lucene.",Portugeese

"Em dezembro de 2009, havia 300 na Flórida, Estados Unidos, e 44 em Amsterdã, nos Países Baixos.",Portugeese
"[152] A Wikipédia empregava um único servidor até 2004, quando a configuração do servidor foi ampliada para uma arquitetura em multicamadas distribuídas.",Portugeese
"Em janeiro de 2005, o projeto funcionava através de 39 servidores dedicados localizados na Flórida.",Portugeese
"Esta configuração inclui um servidor de banco de dados único mestre executando o MySQL, múltiplos servidores de banco de dados escravos, 21 servidores web rodando o Apache HTTP Server e sete servidores de cache rodando o software Squid.",Portugeese
"A Wikipédia recebe entre 25 000 e 60 000 pedidos de página por segundo, dependendo da hora do dia.",Portugeese
[153] As solicitações de página são servidas por uma camada de servidores de cache Squid.,Portugeese
"[154] Além disso, as estatísticas ficam disponíveis publicamente por 3 meses para o acesso da Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"Os pedidos que não podem ser atendidos a partir do cache são enviados para servidores de balanceamento de carga executando o software Linux Virtual Server, que por sua vez, passa a solicitação para um dos servidores web Apache para a renderização de páginas do banco de dados.",Portugeese
"Os servidores web atualizam o cache conforme solicitado, realizando renderização de páginas para todas as versões da Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"Para aumentar a velocidade ainda mais, as páginas processadas são armazenadas em um cache de memória distribuído até ser invalidado, permitindo que a maioria das solicitações de páginas comuns dispensem nova renderização.",Portugeese
Atualmente grande parte da carga de tráfego da Wikipédia é suportada por dois clusters maiores nos Países Baixos e na Coreia do Sul.,Portugeese
"[155] Em sua ideia original, a Wikipédia tinha sido feita para que usuários a lessem e editassem o conteúdo utilizando qualquer navegador de web padrão através de uma conexão de internet fixa.",Portugeese
"No entanto, o conteúdo da Wikipédia está agora também acessível através da web móvel.",Portugeese
"O acesso à Wikipédia partir de telefones móveis foi possível, já em 2004, através do Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), através do serviço Wapedia.",Portugeese
"Em junho de 2007, a Wikipédia lançou o pt.mobile.wikipedia.org, um site oficial para dispositivos sem fio.",Portugeese
"Em 2009 um novo serviço móvel foi lançado oficialmente,[156] localizado em pt.m.wikipedia.org, que atende aos mais avançados dispositivos móveis como o iPhone, dispositivos baseados no Android, ou o Palm Pre.",Portugeese
Vários outros métodos de acesso móvel à Wikipédia surgiram.,Portugeese
"Vários dispositivos e aplicações otimizam ou melhoram a exibição do conteúdo da Wikipédia para dispositivos móveis, enquanto alguns também incorporam funcionalidades adicionais, tais como o uso de metadados da Wikipédia, como a geoinformação.",Portugeese
"[157][158] Alguns observadores afirmam que a Wikipédia é uma ameaça econômica para os editores de enciclopédias tradicionais, muitos dos quais podem ser incapazes de competir com um produto que é essencialmente livre.",Portugeese
"Nicholas Carr escreveu no ensaio ""A amoralidade da Web 2.0"", falando sobre a chamada ""Web 2.0"" como um todo: ""implícita nas visões de êxtase de Web 2.0 é a hegemonia do amador.",Portugeese

"[167][168] O website do Parlamento do Canadá refere-se ao artigo da Wikipédia sobre casamento homossexual no ""links relacionados"" de sua lista de ""leitura adicional"" do ""Civil Marriage Act"".",Portugeese
[169] As afirmações da enciclopédia são cada vez mais utilizadas como fonte por organizações como os tribunais federais dos Estados Unidos e da Organização Mundial da Propriedade Intelectual[170] — mas principalmente para obter informações de apoio ao invés de informações decisivas em um caso.,Portugeese

"[210] Sanger mais tarde esclareceu que as imagens, que eram relativas à pedofilia e uma sobre lolicon, não eram fotos de crianças verdadeiras, mas disse que eram ""representações visuais obscenas do abuso sexual de crianças"", nos termos do PROTECT Act de 2003.",Portugeese
Essa lei proíbe a pornografia infantil fotográfica e as imagens em desenhos animados e quadrinhos que são consideradas obscenas pela legislação americana.,Portugeese
[211] Sanger também expressou preocupações sobre o acesso em escolas às imagens da Wikipédia.,Portugeese

"""[213] Na sequência da queixa apresentada por Larry Sanger, Wales excluíu imagens sexuais sem consultar a comunidade.",Portugeese
"Depois que alguns editores argumentaram que a decisão de excluí-las foi tomada demasiado às pressas, Wales voluntariamente renunciou a alguns dos poderes que detinha por seu estatuto de cofundador.",Portugeese
"Ele escreveu em uma mensagem enviada à lista de correio da Wikimedia Foundation que agira assim ""no interesse de encorajar que esta discussão seja sobre questões reais de filosofia e conteúdo, ao invés de ser sobre mim e sobre a rapidez com que eu agi"".",Portugeese
"[214] O problema de privacidade na Wikipédia envolve o direito de um cidadão de permanecer privado, continuar a ser um ""cidadão"" em vez de uma ""figura pública"" aos olhos da lei.",Portugeese
É uma espécie de batalha entre o direito de ser anônimo no ciberespaço e o direito de ser anônimo na vida real.,Portugeese
"O Wikipedia Watch afirma que ""a Wikipédia é uma ameaça potencial a qualquer pessoa que valorize a vida privada"" e que ""um maior grau de responsabilidade na estrutura da Wikipédia"" seria ""o primeiro passo para solucionar o problema da privacidade"".",Portugeese
"[215] Em 2005 a Agence France-Presse citou Daniel Brandt, o proprietário do Wikipedia Watch, dizendo que ""o problema básico é que ninguém, nem os administradores da Wikimedia Foundation, nem os voluntários que estão conectados com a Wikipédia, consideram-se responsáveis pelo seu conteúdo"".",Portugeese
"[216] Em janeiro de 2006 um tribunal alemão ordenou o fechamento da Wikipédia em alemão na Alemanha por ter publicado o nome completo do Boris Floricic, também conhecido como ""Tron"", um hacker que era antigamente membro do Chaos Computer Club.",Portugeese
"Mais especificamente, o tribunal ordenou que a URL no domínio alemão.de (http://www.wikipedia.de/) não poderia redirecionar para servidores da enciclopédia na Flórida, em http://de.wikipedia.org, embora os leitores alemães ainda permanecessem capazes de usar a URL baseada nos EUA diretamente, e não houve praticamente nenhuma perda de acesso por parte deles.",Portugeese
"A ordem judicial surgiu de uma ação movida pelos pais Floricic, exigindo que o sobrenome de seu filho fosse retirado da Wikipédia.",Portugeese
"[217] Em 9 de fevereiro de 2006 a liminar contra a Wikimedia Deutschland foi anulada, com o juiz rejeitando a noção de que o direito de privacidade de Tron ou de seus pais estivesse sendo violado.",Portugeese
"[218] Os demandantes apelaram para o Tribunal do Estado de Berlim, mas o processo foi recusado em maio de 2006.",Portugeese
"[219] Em dezembro de 2008, o Internet Watch Foundation, organização que lista sites que possuem material ilegal ou potencialmente ilegal, adicionou a Wikipédia à sua lista de sites perigosos.",Portugeese
"Devido a seis dos maiores provedores de internet do Reino Unido usarem o site para bloquear páginas perigosas, 95% das residências do país ficaram impossibilitadas de acessar o site, devido à imagem da capa do álbum Virgin Killer, da banda alemã Scorpions.",Portugeese

"outra coisa, mas eu quero pão normal, pão que eu possa comer, você não tem aquela aparência tão futura esposa do meu pai?",Portugeese
"mas estava com o coração partido por tudo que era intragável, ela logo começou a chorar eu não quero isso, mas a comida é muito boa.",Portugeese
"experimente aqui algumas batatas douradas, elas são muito boas e depois que você se casar comigo.",Portugeese
"você vai ter que comer tudo isso Eu pensei que você gostasse de coisas chiques não, eu não quero casar com você, eu quero ir para casa.",Portugeese

ela correu para abraçar a mãe que estava sentada em casa triste nem irmã da minha querida filha pensei que nunca mais te veria.,Portugeese
"oh mãe eu te amo tanto e você estava certa aparência e riquezas não são tudo o pão de ouro era inútil porque eu não poderia comê-lo e o homem mesmo ele era bonito, ele não se importava nem um pouco comigo, mas minha querida, você percebe que é exatamente assim que você tratava os outros?",Portugeese
"qual foi o seu erro, vamos alimentar você com algo legal daquele dia em diante.",Portugeese
"narcisa mudou seus hábitos, ela lutou no início, mas lentamente e pacientemente ela começou a se tornar muito mais legal um dia, mellie e terry vieram se encontrar com marian novamente oh, olá vocês dois, então nos digam marian.",Portugeese
Como' s narcisismo agora marian contou a ambos tudo o que tinha acontecido e ela mudou muito desde aquela época.,Portugeese

"Le mot nature est un terme polysémique (c’est-à-dire qu'il a plusieurs sens) : il peut signifier la composition et la matière d'une chose (ce qu'elle est, son essence), l'origine et le devenir d'une chose, l'ensemble du réel indépendant de la culture humaine, ou l'ensemble des systèmes et des phénomènes naturels[1].",French
"Au sens commun, la nature peut regrouper : Face au constat des répercussions négatives des activités humaines sur l'environnement biophysique et la perte accélérée de naturalité et de biodiversité au cours des dernières décennies, la protection de la nature et des milieux naturels, la sauvegarde des habitats et des espèces, la mise en place d'un développement durable et raisonnable et l'éducation à l'environnement sont devenues des demandes pour une grande partie des citoyens de la plupart des pays industrialisés.",French
"Les principes de l'éthique environnementale, de nouvelles lois et des chartes de protection de l'environnement fondent le développement d'une idéologie culturelle humaine en relation avec la biosphère.",French
"Si l'étymologie du terme « nature » est relativement bien connue, l'évolution de son sens est beaucoup plus complexe à déterminer, et ce terme a connu des significations très différentes voire contradictoires pendant son histoire[1].",French
Le mot nature est attesté en français depuis 1119[2].,French
"Il vient du latin natura, qui désignait « le cours des choses ; le caractère naturel, la constitution, la qualité ; l'univers » et littéralement « naissance ».",French
"Le terme vient lui-même du verbe nascor (« naître »), ici au supin[1].",French
"Si ce terme signifie essentiellement le « caractère inné » au IIe siècle avant notre ère, le latin classique, notamment par le biais de Cicéron, va l'enrichir de tous les sens du terme grec phusis, beaucoup plus complexe et obscur et dont il devient la traduction en philosophie latine[1].",French
"Phusis vient du verbe phuein, dérivé de la racine phu qui désigne la croissance végétale.",French
"Phuein, c'est l'éclosion, ce qui se manifeste en révélant ce qui était contenu dans la semence ; ainsi, le phuein, c'est le propre de la plante qui croît à partir de soi-même, qui a son centre de changement à l'intérieur et non pas à l'extérieur, comme une pierre.",French
"Pour Merleau-Ponty, cette parenté de la phusis et du végétal fait que « est nature ce qui a un sens, sans que ce sens ait été posé par la pensée.",French
C'est l'autoproduction d'un sens »[3].,French
"Cette étymologie indique que les anciens grecs et romains avaient une conception dynamique, « vitaliste » de la nature[1], conception selon laquelle le vivant n'est pas réductible aux lois physico-chimiques de la matière[4].",French
"Pour les grecs de l'antiquité, Aristote en particulier, la nature est une puissance d'engendrement des êtres, mais cette puissance n'est pas séparée des choses elles-mêmes, elle leur est « immanente » : « chaque être naturel a en soi-même un principe de mouvement et de repos »[5].",French
"Aristote énumère cependant plusieurs définitions différentes de la nature, et introduit une opposition entre le naturel et l'artificiel : le naturel est ce qui est produit par la phusis, ce qui existe par soi-même, l'artificiel est ce qui est produit par la technè, par l'action et le travail (d'Hommes, d'animaux ou de dieux).",French
C'est cette opposition qui sera plus tard reprise dans la philosophie romaine par Cicéron à travers l'opposition nature/culture[1].,French
"Cette première approche dynamique et vitaliste s'est estompée au XVIIe siècle où le mot devient synonyme d'univers matériel, réglé par des lois[1].",French
"C'est ainsi que Fontenelle, après Descartes, dira que « la nature est en grand ce qu'une montre est en petit »[6].",French
"Mais si cette vision mécaniste de la nature reste encore largement répandue, elle a été critiquée par la génération romantique au début du XIXe siècle, et notamment par Engels dans son Anti-Dühring[7] : pour lui il faut concevoir la nature, aussi bien sur terre que dans l'univers comme un processus évolutif, historique et dialectique : rien dans la nature ne reste identique à soi, tout change et se transforme en permanence.",French
"Cette nouvelle approche redevenue dynamique s'illustrera pendant tout le XIXe siècle, notamment à travers Darwin qui instaure, dans la foulée de Buffon, une approche historique de la nature, qui n'est dès lors plus fixe : les espèces évoluent en permanence, ainsi que les milieux dans lesquels elles vivent.",French
"Tandis que Darwin se concentre sur l'histoire des êtres, celle des roches sera illustrée par Alfred Wegener, qui théorise la dérive des continents.",French
La première grande philosophie de la nature se trouve dans l'œuvre d'Aristote.,French
"Selon lui, « la nature ne fait rien en  vain », ce qui signifie que la nature est une puissance orientée vers certaines  fins.",French
L'explication  scientifique consistera donc à découvrir cette finalité.,French
"Par exemple, si l'eau monte dans un tuyau dont on aspire l'air, c'est parce que ""la nature a horreur du vide"".",French
"Selon Jan Patocka, « On peut demander si cette philosophie ne nous offre pas un cas typique d'anthropomorphisme »[8].",French
En fait Aristote pense l'action de la nature à partir du travail de l'artisan qui imprime une forme à la matière pour arriver à son but qui est de créer un objet.,French
La différence est que le travail de l'artisan reste extérieur à la matière alors que la nature agit à l'intérieur de la matière :« chaque être naturel a en soi-même un principe de mouvement et de repos »[9].,French
"Mais cette action de la nature est infiniment plus parfaite que celle de l'artisan et de sa ""techné"".« l'homme ne peut produire d'être vivant, ni d'être animé aussi parfait que les êtres de nature »[10].",French
C'est pourquoi Aristote affirme que « l'art imite la nature »[11] Cette conception finaliste de la nature a été contredite par la philosophie mecaniste développée au XVII°siècle par Descartes.,French
Selon Miguel Espinoza « le mécanisme est le squelette métaphysique de la science »[12].,French
"Dans cette philosophie, la nature n'est plus vue comme une puissance orientée vers la perfection et que l'homme devrait imiter, mais comme un univers matériel soumis à des règles   (""les lois de la nature"").",French
"Connaissant ces règles, l'homme peut alors se rendre « comme maître et possesseur de la nature » (Descartes).",French
"Cependant, cette conception réduit la nature à un statut d'objet dont les êtres humains (les sujets) pourraient disposer à leur guise.",French
L'écologie contemporaine a montré les limites de ce dualisme.,French
"Comme le dit Michel Serres nous devons modifier notre rapport à la nature : il propose dans son livre ""Le contrat naturel"" (1990) de considérer la nature comme ""un sujet de droit"" : « la nature serait ce sujet de droit avec lequel on passerait ce fameux contrat.",French
"»[13] Dans la même perspective François Flahault montre que la séparation de l'homme et de la nature remonte au dualisme platonicien et chrétien qui séparent l'âme et le corps, et il propose de s'en affranchir en prenant conscience que l'homme fait intégralement partie de la nature.",French
"Il nous faut « reconnaître à qui et à quoi nous devons la vie - et le verbe ""devoir"", ici, nous oriente vers la gratitude et le soin, nous invite à cultiver des relations d'affiliation, à assumer des responsabilités et des devoirs -.",French
"» [14] Dans l'usage commun et religieux, la nature a longtemps été présentée dichotomiquement en Europe, comme ce qui est autour de l'Homme, qui n'est pas lui (opposé à la culture), et qui est animé par des processus ou des forces qui lui échappent[réf.",French
"souhaitée] vu de façon horizontale, puis lors du Moyen Âge et avec l'arrivée de la pensée industrielle, une hiérarchie entre l'homme et la nature s'impose, l'homme est au-dessus de la nature, jusqu'à arriver à un stade d'opposition à la nature[15].",French
"À présent, avec les progrès scientifiques, il est généralement considéré comme acquis que l'espèce humaine soit parmi d'autres dans la nature.",French
"Les sciences et notamment l'écologie montrent que la nature (co-)évolue dans le temps et l'espace, selon des dynamiques complexes, incluant celles de l'évolution des espèces, la sélection naturelle, et que les forces animées ou détournées par l'être humain ou d'autres espèces sont devenues capables de modifier les grands processus naturels planétaires.",French
"Dans l'interprétation des philosophies animistes ou religieuses, la nature est présentée comme manifestant l'équivalent d'une volonté autonome ou d'un sens déterminé.",French
"Ainsi, celle-ci se vengera de ce qu'on lui fait de mal, ou au contraire rendra au centuple le bien qu'on lui fait.",French
Certains actes sont considérés comme contre nature.,French
"Ces expressions laissent penser que des cultures de l'homme contemporain accordent une valeur particulière à la Nature, d'ordre éthique, d'ordre moral ou d'ordre naturel, qu'il s'y inclut ou non.",French
La nature est perçue par les sens et est pensée de façon variable selon les espèces et les individus inclus[réf.,French
souhaitée].,French
"Du point de vue philosophique, la distinction se fait simplement entre la nature, la nature des espèces et la représentation de la nature humaine (Homo sapiens).",French
"Le raisonnement confine, limite et précise donc par défaut la capacité humaine et l'envergure à accorder, à reconnaître et à considérer à la valeur de l'exercice.",French
La représentation de la « nature humaine » correspond logiquement aux philosophies humaines existantes et aux cultures humaines possibles.,French
"La « philosophie de la nature » est un sujet d'apparence inexplorable par l'être vivant, malgré de multiples miroitements perceptibles.",French
"D'une certaine façon, on peut dire que le christianisme, suivant la tradition biblique et judaïque, a désacralisé la nature, qui fut alors associée à celle d’une transcendance divine, extérieure à l'homme[1].",French
Le mot même de « nature » n'apparaît jamais dans la Bible[1].,French
"Dans la Genèse, la nature est présentée dans le récit de la Création, comme l'œuvre d'un Dieu créateur : La Création se poursuit tout au long de « six jours ».",French
"Le sixième jour, Dieu crée l'homme et la femme : La nature est alors présentée comme un accès à l’Écriture sainte.",French
"Actuellement, pour les catholiques, la nature est l'appellation laïque de création.",French
"Saint Augustin, reprenant la tradition philosophique grecque, voit dans les créatures deux types de nature : l'essence (essentia) et la substance (substantia).",French
"Pour lui, « même le plus ignorant lit dans le monde ».",French
Les clés d'accès aux Écritures sont alors les quatre sens de l'Écriture.,French
La littérature allégorique du Moyen Âge faisait appel à plusieurs de ces sens pour l'interprétation des textes.,French
"Alain de Lille (1114-1203) écrivit par exemple deux poèmes (Anticlaudianus et De planctu Naturae) dont le principal personnage est « Nature », qui est une figure emblématique des lois du monde créé par Dieu.",French
"Il précise que ces poèmes doivent être lus à trois niveaux : au sens littéral (pour l'entendement puéril), au sens moral, ou au sens allégorique[16].",French
"Une autre illustration de ces représentations de la nature se trouve dans la série des tapisseries de La Dame à la licorne, qui est toute chargée d'allégories[17].",French
"L’idée sous-jacente est que la nature ne fait rien au hasard, mais est soumise à un commandement divin.",French
"Le transcendantalisme, né au XIXe siècle, suit le principe selon lequel la nature est un être divin, apprenant à l'homme la raison et la beauté[1].",French
Les transcendantalistes trouvent dans la nature une source d'expériences et d'aventures indispensables au développement intellectuel et spirituel de l'Homme.,French
Cette idée prévaut jusqu’à l'apparition de la conception moderne de la science (Galilée).,French
"Nouvelles représentations Avec Galilée et Descartes, une nouvelle représentation du monde apparaît avec une nouvelle hiérarchie.",French
"Descartes rejette la philosophie scolastique : Dans sa philosophie, Descartes introduisit des rapports radicalement nouveaux entre  l'homme et la nature, divisant le monde entre « res extensa » (les choses, donc la nature, passive) et « res cogitans » (l'esprit, donc l'Homme et Dieu, actifs et pourvus d'une intentionnalité)[1].",French
"Avec l’âge classique au XVIIe siècle, et la naissance de la science moderne, on assiste ainsi à l’invention d'une nouvelle représentation de la nature.",French
"Cette représentation est le résultat de la croyance de beaucoup de philosophes des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles, selon lesquels la nature était gouvernée par une loi universelle, la gravitation.",French
On perçoit une extension des limites du monde connu à d'autres planètes.,French
Le monde s'étend alors au système solaire dont on connaît les « lois » d'évolution qu'il est possible de décrire sous une forme mathématique.,French
La méthode expérimentale permit de faire progresser la connaissance de l’histoire « naturelle » (i.e.,French
des sciences naturelles).,French
Ce qui a fait dire à Maurice Merleau-Ponty « Ce ne sont pas les découvertes scientifiques qui ont provoqué le changement de l’idée de Nature.,French
C’est le changement de l’idée de Nature qui a permis ces découvertes »[19].,French
"Émancipation de la pensée L'époque moderne a aussi inventé la liberté de pensée (cogito ergo sum, dit Descartes), il devient possible de parler publiquement d'athéisme.",French
"L’intervention divine devient alors plus abstraite, confinée au mystère de la foi.",French
"Ainsi, certaines formes d'empirisme ne rejettent pas la notion de foi et de religion, au contraire : la méthode expérimentale du physicien et chimiste irlandais Robert Boyle, par exemple, s'appuie sur une foi vécue dans l'expérimentation scientifique.",French
"Descartes rejette la conception aristotélicienne de la nature, l'existence de Dieu étant perçue sur un plan purement métaphysique.",French
"Une nouvelle conception de l’homme apparut au XVIIIe siècle, un homme qui s'appuie davantage sur la raison et sur l'expérience pour comprendre le monde.",French
"Au XIXe siècle, la notion même de métaphysique s'estompe presque complètement, submergée par les idéologies.",French
"Spinoza reviendra sur les propos de Descartes qu'il récuse notamment à travers son expression Deus sive Natura (« Dieu, c'est-à-dire la Nature »).",French
"Spinoza, dans Le Traité théologico-politique et l'Éthique identifie Dieu à une Nature « nécessaire », divinité infinie et immanente qui fait un avec la nature.",French
La substance universelle se compose ainsi aussi bien du corps que de l'esprit.,French
"La conception de l'homme, développée par Descartes, est tardive en Occident, mais également inédite dans l’histoire du monde.",French
Les sciences humaines n’héritent pas d’un domaine vacant car l’« homme n’existait pas ».,French
Mais cette émancipation partielle de l'humanité n'a pas pour autant supprimé toute forme de croyance.,French
"Pendant les Lumières, alors que les pratiques religieuses sont souvent perçues comme des superstitions par les philosophes, la conception populaire d'une sacralisation de la nature prit une emphase toute particulière.",French
"Ainsi, la croyance en un dieu créateur est très présente à travers le déisme : Voltaire ne croyait-il pas en un dieu créateur, qui aurait abandonné l'humanité à son triste destin ?",French
Cette croyance poussée à l'extrême engendra le culte de la Raison et de l'Être suprême.,French
"Il est significatif de constater que dans ce contexte de déchristianisation, parmi les fêtes civiques, c'est la fête de la nature qui aura réellement du succès.",French
Évolutions sémantiques et esthétiques Ce changement de représentation se fit à la faveur d'un changement linguistique majeur : l'apparition du français classique[20].,French
"Ainsi, le mot physique, qui étymologiquement, en grec, signifie la nature dans son ensemble (phusika), changea de sens pour prendre un sens presque exclusivement scientifique.",French
Un autre corollaire fut une évolution de la sensibilité esthétique.,French
"La hiérarchie des genres de la peinture classique, par exemple, accordait peu d'importance au paysage.",French
Celui-ci occupa à partir du XIXe siècle une place beaucoup plus importante.,French
La conception cartésienne de la nature n'a pas pour autant supprimé le sens que donnent les naturalistes à ce mot.,French
"L'histoire des sciences naturelles montre que l'interaction des êtres vivants entre eux et avec leur milieu a été une préoccupation constante de beaucoup de scientifiques, qui a pris une importance croissante jusqu'à l'avènement d'une écologie plus holistique, dont la naissance peut se situer vers le XVIIIe siècle.",French
"Elle illustre la diversité des thèmes étudiés en écologie, et de façon plus générale dans les sciences naturelles.",French
"Une étude de 2020[1] suggère qu'il existe actuellement quatre sens principaux au terme « nature », irréductibles les uns aux autres : La notion de nature porte donc en elle des questions philosophiques, à travers les rapports que l'homme entretient avec le milieu naturel et l'environnement, ses conceptions de la vie sociale, et les multiples sens qu'il est possible d'attribuer au mot nature dans les représentations sociales.",French
Le mot nature a donc conservé des sens multiples (polysémie).,French
"Les préoccupations environnementales actuelles montrent combien il importe d'identifier ces sens et leurs finalités dans chaque contexte particulier : suivant la définition utilisée, le rapport de l'Humanité à la « nature » n'est pas le même, et l'idée de « conservation de la nature » change d'objet, d'objectifs et de méthodes[1].",French
La nature recouvre les réalités suivantes : La Terre est la seule planète connue pour abriter la vie et ses caractéristiques naturelles font l'objet de nombreuses recherches scientifiques.,French
"Au sein du Système solaire, c'est la troisième la plus proche du Soleil ; c'est la plus grande planète tellurique et la cinquième plus grande de toutes.",French
"Ses principales caractéristiques climatiques sont la présence de deux grandes régions polaires, deux zones tempérées relativement étroites et une vaste région équatoriale tropicale à subtropicale[21][réf.",French
à confirmer].,French
"Les précipitations varient considérablement selon l'endroit, de plusieurs mètres d'eau par année à moins d'un millimètre[réf.",French
nécessaire].,French
71 % de la surface de la Terre est recouverte d'océans d'eau salée.,French
Le reste est constitué de continents et d'îles[réf.,French
"nécessaire], la majeure partie des terres habitées se trouvant dans l'hémisphère Nord[pertinence contestée].",French
La Terre a évolué grâce à des processus géologiques et biologiques qui ont laissé des traces des conditions originales.,French
La surface extérieure est divisée en plusieurs plaques tectoniques qui migrent progressivement.,French
"L'intérieur reste actif, avec une épaisse couche de manteau en convection et un noyau rempli de fer qui génère un champ magnétique.",French
Ce noyau de fer est composé d'une phase interne solide et d'une phase externe fluide.,French
"Le mouvement de convection dans le noyau génère des courants électriques par dynamo qui, à leur tour, génèrent le champ géomagnétique[réf.",French
nécessaire].,French
"Les conditions atmosphériques ont été considérablement modifiées par rapport aux conditions d'origine par la présence de formes de vie[22], ce qui crée un équilibre écologique qui stabilise les conditions de surface.",French
"Malgré les grandes variations régionales du climat selon la latitude et d'autres facteurs géographiques, le climat mondial moyen à long terme est assez stable pendant les périodes interglaciaires[23], et les variations d'un degré ou deux de la température moyenne mondiale ont eu historiquement des effets majeurs sur l'équilibre écologique et sur la géographie de la Terre[24],[25].",French
Voir : Le caractère imprécis de la définition même de « Nature » entretient une ambiguïté dans la relation entre Hommes et Nature[1].,French
"La biosphère terrestre étant de plus en plus marquée par l'empreinte de l'Homme, il devient de plus en plus difficile d'y trouver des espaces purement « naturels » au sens de « dépourvus d'influence humaine ».",French
"La nature au sens le plus strict est refoulée d'une part vers le bas, dans le sous-sol lointain et les grands fonds océaniques, et d'autre part vers le haut, dans l'espace intersidéral.",French
Les phénomènes climatiques eux-mêmes ne sont plus considérés comme indépendants de l'activité humaine.,French
"D'un autre côté, le concept est souvent employé dans un sens dérivé pour désigner des espaces aménagés par l'homme mais dans lesquels une large place est réservée à des peuplements végétaux et animaux ; c'est ainsi qu'on peut parler de nature à propos d'une forêt, même si elle est cultivée et exploitée depuis des siècles, et qu'on qualifie même de parcs naturels des territoires où s'exercent des activités agricoles intensives dotées de moyens mécaniques et chimiques modernes.",French
"Dans ce cas, le qualificatif naturel désigne certaines caractéristiques paysagères (variables selon le lieu et sans définition universelle) et n'implique pas l'absence d'artifice humain.",French
"Il fait référence à un mode de gestion de l'espace par l'Homme, plutôt qu'à une absence d'intervention humaine.",French
"Le mot naturel a également été employé à l'époque coloniale dans un sens équivalent à celui du mot anglais native, c'est-à-dire au sens étymologique, pour désigner les habitants natifs des pays colonisés.",French
"Cette appellation, qui ne se voulait pas injurieuse, avait cependant une connotation raciste dans la mesure où elle suggérait que ces hommes vivaient dans des conditions plus « proches de la nature » que les autres.",French
"Dans le même ordre d'idées, l'imagination populaire représente souvent les hommes de la Préhistoire comme plus naturels que les hommes d'aujourd'hui, suggérant que la nature correspond à un état primitif dont le progrès amène inéluctablement à s'éloigner.",French
L'idée de nature a été remaniée par la culture urbaine à travers la notion mythique de sauvagerie désignant de manière générale ce qui est extérieur à la civilisation.,French
Le fait que le même mot sauvage soit utilisé d'une part comme un synonyme de naturel et d'autre part pour qualifier des actes particulièrement violents ou cruels (même s'ils sont commis dans des sociétés urbaines avec des moyens techniques sophistiqués) met bien en évidence une certaine tradition idéologique qui place plus ou moins consciemment du côté de la nature ce qui est étranger à la culture dominante et/ou mauvais.,French
"Paradoxalement, il se trouve aussi que, dans d'autres contextes, le mot naturel est employé dans la langue populaire comme un synonyme de normal, légitime ou logique ; la Nature, lieu de la sauvagerie, est donc aussi celui du bon sens fondamental et, par voie de conséquence, elle est la source des principes les plus légitimes de l'Homme civilisé.",French
"Le développement des sciences et des techniques au cours des deux derniers siècles a été, de son côté, largement accompagné par une idéologie d'opposition entre l'Homme et la Nature, la connaissance étant généralement perçue comme un instrument de domination de la Nature plutôt que comme un moyen de vivre en harmonie avec elle.",French
"Cette époque a vu aussi se développer la philosophie du droit naturel, dont découlent notamment les droits de l'homme et selon laquelle l'Homme se verrait attribuer par nature des prérogatives immuables ; mais ici le paradoxe n'est qu'apparent, car dans ce contexte la notion de nature est employée dans le sens de nature humaine, et n'implique aucune espèce de « réconciliation » avec la Nature (la promotion des droits de l'homme est d'ailleurs, jusqu'à présent, indépendante de toute préoccupation environnementale)[26].",French
"En fait, la distinction entre l'humain et le naturel repose essentiellement sur des notions historiques et subjectives, voire contradictoires.",French
La question de son bien-fondé universel reste ouverte.,French
"La distinction (parfois conçue comme une opposition) a été inspirée et justifiée par le besoin, d'origine religieuse ou découlant de certaines formes d'humanisme, de représenter l'Homme comme un être en-dehors ou au-dessus de la Nature même si par ailleurs l'Homme n'est pas séparable de son environnement naturel avec lequel il est en interaction permanente et dont il ne peut pas plus s'affranchir que n'importe quelle autre espèce vivante[1].",French
"Voir les thèmes suivants : La forêt, stratégiquement importante pour la fourniture du bois, a fait l'objet d'une protection foncière particulière, renforcée en France depuis Colbert au XVIIe siècle.",French
"Récemment, le génome des espèces sauvages ou domestiques a pris une valeur juridique particulière avec une privatisation permise par « marques » de propriété d'hybrides et variétés végétales « créées » (ou isolées) par les semenciers puis les premières autorisations de brevetage du vivant.",French
"Mais la faune, la flore, la fonge et les organismes vivant sont encore en France et dans de nombreux pays considéré par le législateur comme res nullius (chose sans propriétaire).",French
"Depuis peu, et au niveau international, ils tendent cependant à être identifiés comme une partie du bien commun, qu'est la biodiversité, source de services écosystémiques ; ce qui donne une « valeur » nouvelle à la nature, notamment marquée en Europe par les directives Habitat ou Oiseaux.",French
"La « Nature » a récemment dans plusieurs pays, dont en France acquis un droit de protection, puis de représentation, assimilable dans une certaine mesure et dans certains cas à celui des droits des « victimes ».",French
"Ainsi, les aménageurs doivent prospectivement appliquer le principe « éviter > réduire > compenser » les impacts écologiques lors des grands projets[27].",French
"Et, en cas de pollution ou de catastrophe, le pollueur doit maintenant prendre en charge des compensations et/ou réparations.",French
"Théoriquement, cela se fait selon le principe pollueur-payeur, qui reste cependant difficile à appliquer quand la pollution est ancienne ou diffuse.",French
"Le principe de « préjudice écologique » a été en France, en 2012, confirmé par la Cour de Cassation lors du procès de l'Erika.",French
"La notion de nature renvoie a priori à l’idée d’un domaine ayant ses propres principes de développement, qui serait hors de l’action de l’homme.",French
"Or, on réalise aujourd'hui que le changement climatique a une origine anthropique.",French
L’idée de nature n’est donc pas suffisante.,French
Il y a une complémentarité et une interaction entre la nature et les communautés humaines.,French
L’esquisse de cette complémentarité réciproque peut s'éclairer avec la notion de culture écologique.,French
"On constate par exemple que les notions de patrimoine naturel et de patrimoine culturel sont intimement liées, en observant le patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO qui dresse une liste de sites naturels et culturels.",French
"La convention de 2007 de l'UNESCO souligne l'interaction des communautés humaines avec la nature, dans la définition qui a été donnée du patrimoine culturel immatériel : Voir aussi : Culture et nature La notion de culture recouvre deux sens : Le premier correspond à l’idée de civilisation.",French
"Cette idée est aussi ancienne que l'histoire de l'humanité, mais a trouvé une nouvelle signification avec la Philosophie des Lumières.",French
"Dans ce sens, la culture est le trait distinctif de l’espèce humaine, associé à ses savoirs et savoir-faire.",French
Cette conception française de la culture serait plutôt individualiste.,French
"Le second est le sens allemand, émergeant sous l’influence du romantisme.",French
"La culture est la configuration particulière de croyances coutumières, traits matériels, organisations sociales… elle est une totalité singulière, une sphère autonome incommensurables avec d’autres totalités.",French
Cette conception plus collective s'oppose à la conception française.,French
"Dans Les Mots et les Choses, Michel Foucault définit l’anthropologie comme l’étude des rapports entre la nature et la culture.",French
Globalement on peut appréhender cette question en distinguant les anthropologies matérialistes et les anthropologies symbolistes.,French
Les anthropologies matérialistes s’intéressent aux fonctions structurantes de la vie matérielle.,French
"L’idée sous-jacente est que la nature est un déterminant de base : elle y est définie en termes ethnocentrique, comme étant le moteur de la vie sociale.",French
"On y trouve l’anthropologie marxiste des années 1970 en France, pour laquelle la nature est une donnée brute qui peut être appropriée ou transformée, et l’environnement naturel est une précondition de l’environnement économique.",French
"On trouve aussi la sociobiologie et l’écologie culturelle, entre lesquelles on souligne un certain parallèle puisque pour les deux, la cause ultime des comportements revient au champ de la nature.",French
"Dans tous les cas, pour les anthropologies matérialistes, la culture est une forme particulière d’adaptation à une nature qui serait partout un élément déterminant et conditionnant.",French
Les anthropologies symbolistes s’intéressent aux caractères symboliques de la vie sociale.,French
Elles mettent l’accent sur les aptitudes des hommes à créer un monde de signification et d’intentionnalités dépendant des déterminations brutes de la nature.,French
"Dans Anthropologie Structurale 2, Lévi-Strauss dit que l’anthropologie est la discipline qui pense la relation entre la nature et la culture.",French
"La dichotomie nature / culture soulevée, l’opposition nature / culture suggère deux possibilités.",French
Soit la culture est ce qui donne un sens à nature (la culture impose sa signification à la nature).,French
Soit la nature détermine les rapports sociaux (la nature donne forme à la culture).,French
La dichotomie nature / culture utilisée comme outil analytique est en partie dérivée de Claude Lévi-Strauss.,French
Il l’a notamment utilisée comme opérateur central pour décoder les mythologies.,French
Celui-ci a été reconnu pertinent par les ethnologues de ces sociétés amérindiennes.,French
"La mythologie retrace la construction de la nature sur un fond initial d’indifférenciation culturelle (ainsi, dans les mythes amérindiens, au début les animaux et les hommes avaient la même apparence).",French
"Chez Lévi-Strauss, l’opposition, là où elle est pertinente, c’est-à-dire dans les mythes, n’est qu’une façon de mettre une étiquette sur des contrastes.",French
L’écologie culturelle donne un crédit illimité à la nature.,French
"L’anthropologie structurale, à ce propos, n’oppose pas une forme d’idéalisme mais aussi un naturalisme, mais un naturalisme de principe.",French
"Lévi-Strauss n’a jamais varié dans l’idée que la nature conditionne les opérations intellectuelles, la nature devenant donc une construction empirique.",French
L’étude naturaliste doit permettre de comprendre la structure des groupes culturels.,French
Ce qui intéresse Lévi-Strauss est de rendre compte de la manière dont l’esprit opère dans des contextes culturels et géographiques distincts (ex : les Mythologiques).,French
"La mythologie révèle dans une forme épurée les opérations d’un esprit qui n’est plus condamné à mettre en ordre, mais qui peut « jouer » avec les règles de fonctionnement de la pensée.",French
"La dichotomie nature / culture est une spécificité culturelle occidentale développée en Europe à partir de la Renaissance puis en Occident moderne de Descartes à Darwin, qui s’est répandue dans le monde entier, en même temps que s’accroissait l’influence politique, culturelle et commerciale de l’Occident (Grandes découvertes, colonisation, science occidentale), mais qui n'est pas partagée universellement[1],[28].",French
"Ce paradigme n’est pas simplement un outil analytique parmi d’autres, il est aussi la clef de voûte de l’épistémologie moderne.",French
"Ainsi, Philippe Descola dans Par-delà nature et culture (2005) distingue quatre « modes d’identification » qui sont le totémisme, l’animisme, l'analogisme et le naturalisme.",French
"Selon lui, seule la société naturaliste (occidentale) produit cette frontière entre soi et autrui à travers l’idée de « nature » dans le sens de « ce qui ne relève pas de la culture », ce qui ne relève pas des traits distinctifs de l’espèce humaine, et des savoirs et savoir-faire humains (une des quatre définitions énumérées plus haut)[1].",French
Son usage comme outil analytique en ethnologie a parfois été fécond.,French
"Toutefois, et Descola l’a montré dans Par-delà nature et culture, l’idée de nature est étrangère à de nombreuses sociétés.",French
Wikipédia Écouter est une encyclopédie universelle et multilingue créée par Jimmy Wales et Larry Sanger le 15 janvier 2001.,French
"Il s'agit d'une œuvre libre, c'est-à-dire que chacun est libre de la rediffuser.",French
"Gérée en wiki dans le site web wikipedia.org grâce au logiciel MediaWiki, elle permet à tous les internautes d'écrire et de modifier des articles.",French
Elle est devenue en quelques années l'encyclopédie la plus fournie et la plus consultée au monde.,French
L'organisation à but non lucratif américaine Wikimedia Foundation est dépositaire de la marque Wikipedia.,French
Elle finance l'hébergement web de l'encyclopédie.,French
"L'anglais a été la première langue utilisée, et Wikipédia en anglais compte plus de six millions d'articles début 2020.",French
"Wikipédia en français, ouverte le 23 mars 2001, compte un peu plus de deux millions d'articles la même année.",French
"Wikipédia existe en plus de 300 langues, dans une apparence unie, mais avec de grandes variations de contenus.",French
"En mars 2000, Jimmy Wales met en ligne sur le Web une encyclopédie libre[1] appelée Nupedia.",French
"Il bénéficie pour cela du soutien de la société Bomis, dont il est l'actionnaire majoritaire[2].",French
Larry Sanger est engagé dans cette société au titre de rédacteur en chef.,French
"Comme Nupedia fonctionne avec un comité scientifique, la progression du nombre d'articles est très lente[3].",French
"Le 2 janvier 2001, Larry Sanger discute avec le programmeur Ben Kovitz, qui lui explique le concept du wiki.",French
"Vu la frustration occasionnée par la lenteur des progrès de Nupedia, Larry Sanger propose à Jimmy Wales de créer un wiki sous licence publique générale GNU afin d'accroître la vitesse de développement des articles, ce qui aboutit au lancement formel de Wikipédia le 15 janvier 2001[1],[2].",French
"En effet, étymologiquement, le terme « Wikipédia » est un mot-valise issu de la fusion de deux termes : wiki, type de site Web collaboratif (d'après le mot hawaïen wikiwiki qui signifie « rapide »[4]), se référant au fait que l'encyclopédie a toujours vocation à s'améliorer rapidement et à être constamment active de par son mode de fonctionnement, et -pédia, dérivé du mot grec παιδεία, paideia, « instruction », « éducation ».",French
"Ce nouveau projet devait servir à fournir du contenu textuel selon une méthode plus souple, permettant ensuite éventuellement d'alimenter Nupedia, après un passage par le filtre d'un comité d'experts.",French
La version française de Wikipédia est officiellement créée le 23 mars 2001.,French
"Elle est la première version de Wikipédia dans une langue autre que l'anglais, suivie par les versions en allemand et en catalan[2].",French
"À partir de ce moment, Larry Sanger travaille parallèlement sur Nupedia et Wikipédia.",French
Il participe à l'élaboration de la plupart des règles de fonctionnement de cette dernière[2].,French
"En février 2002, la rétribution de son travail pour Nupedia et Wikipédia est supprimée du budget alloué par Bomis ; en conséquence de quoi il démissionne officiellement le 1er mars 2002 de ses fonctions sur les deux projets[a].",French
"En 2003, la progression de Nupedia stagne, alors que Wikipédia se développe très rapidement.",French
"Le 26 septembre 2003, Nupedia est définitivement fermée et son contenu intégré à Wikipédia, qui poursuit son expansion.",French
"Selon Larry Sanger, Nupedia a échoué à cause d'une chaîne éditoriale trop lourde et de la difficulté à trouver des rédacteurs bénévoles[2].",French
"Le 20 juin 2003, la Wikimedia Foundation est créée pour financer le soutien technique de Wikipédia[5].",French
"Jimmy Wales intervient fin 2005 sur l'article « Wikipedia » de Wikipédia en anglais, pour retirer l'information selon laquelle Larry Sanger en était cofondateur, puisque Sanger a toujours été un salarié.",French
"Cet événement donne lieu à de nombreux articles dans la presse anglophone, ainsi qu'à des images humoristiques sur le sujet[b].",French
"Lors du 5e symposium international sur le journalisme en ligne, Jonathan Dee, du New York Times[6], et Andrew Lih[7] mentionnent l'importance de Wikipédia, non seulement comme une encyclopédie de référence mais aussi comme une ressource d'actualités très fréquemment mise à jour.",French
L'attention a cependant été attirée à de nombreuses reprises sur des problèmes éditoriaux internes à l'encyclopédie[8].,French
"Lorsque le magazine Time a reconnu « Vous » (You) comme personnalité de l'année 2006, en reconnaissant l'accélération de la collaboration en ligne et l'interaction de millions d'utilisateurs dans le monde, il a cité Wikipédia comme l'un des trois exemples de services Web 2.0, avec YouTube et Myspace[9].",French
"En 2015, la Fondation Wikimedia, qui héberge les données des Wikipédias sur ses serveurs, lance une initiative de « durabilité » afin de réduire les impacts environnementaux de ses activités[réf.",French
souhaitée].,French
"Le 15 janvier 2021, à l'occasion des 20 ans d'existence de Wikipédia, les médias publient un grand nombre d'articles sur l'encyclopédie collaborative, son projet et son histoire.",French
"L'encyclopédie est éditée sur le site wikipedia.org, qui est devenu en quelques années l'un des plus consultés au monde.",French
"Les serveurs hébergeant le site sont financés par une fondation américaine, la Wikimedia Foundation.",French
"Depuis son lancement officiel, Wikipédia est en grande partie modifiable par la plupart de ses lecteurs.",French
"Les mêmes principes fondateurs de rédaction sont partagés par les différentes versions linguistiques, mais les pratiques d'écriture sont convenues indépendamment par les internautes pour chacune d'elles.",French
"Plusieurs autres moyens de consulter l'encyclopédie avec internet ont vu le jour, tels que des sites web miroirs[10], un appareil électronique dédié, le WikiReader, ou des applications pour smartphone.",French
"De 2012 à février 2018, le programme Wikipedia Zero a permis une diffusion gratuite de l’encyclopédie et des projets annexes dans les pays du Sud.",French
"Grâce à un partenariat avec des opérateurs de téléphonie mobile, l’accès à Wikipédia sur téléphone portable n’était pas décompté du forfait[11].",French
"Ce programme a été arrêté du fait de la faible audience de Wikipedia pour les pays concernés, et de l'inadéquation aux nouveaux types d'appareils téléphoniques.",French
"La recherche de moyens techniques et économiques permettant de rendre accessibles les informations de Wikipédia par d'autres voies que le Web, est liée au projet d'une diffusion la plus large possible des connaissances.",French
Le projet de distribution sur papier était destiné en particulier aux personnes n'ayant pas les moyens de se raccorder à Internet.,French
"La réalisation d'une version de Wikipédia en anglais sur papier, CD-ROM ou DVD fut initiée[c] en août 2003 par Jimmy Wales.",French
"Jusqu'en 2014, il a été possible de commander une sélection d'articles de Wikipédia appelée « Livres », imprimée et reliée (pour laquelle la Fondation Wikimédia percevait 10 % sur les ventes brutes des ouvrages[12]).",French
"Courant 2015, l'artiste Michael Mandiberg imprima 106 des 7 473 volumes correspondant à la version anglophone de l'encyclopédie dans le cadre d'un projet intitulé « Print Wikipedia »[13].",French
"La version allemande de Wikipédia fut vendue sur CD-ROM, puis sur DVD à partir du deuxième semestre 2004 : le nombre de 10 000 CD-ROM vendus fut franchi en avril 2005.",French
"En avril 2007, une sélection d'environ 2 000 articles de la version anglaise fut éditée sur CD-ROM par la société française Linterweb[14] .",French
"À la même époque, le projet moulinWiki, initié par IESC-Geekcorps-Mali, proposa une version intégrale incluant tous les articles, sans les images, réunis sur une image disque de 554 Mo[15].",French
"La diffusion d'un DVD d'une sélection d'articles Wikipédia en français a fait l'objet d'un projet équivalent au projet anglophone, mais il n'a pas abouti.",French
"Un projet de diffusion de documents électroniques imprimables sur un sujet donné, Les Cahiers de Wikipédia, a lui aussi été abandonné.",French
"Kiwix est l'un des principaux logiciels libres permettant de consulter Wikipédia à partir d'un ordinateur personnel sous Windows, Mac OS, GNU/Linux, iOS ou Android en mode hors connexion.",French
"Il permet de lire un fichier au format ZIM contenant n'importe quelle version linguistique de Wikipedia et de la plupart de ses projets annexes (Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, etc.",French
"), textes et illustrations comprises (la taille du fichier correspondant variant selon la version linguistique utilisée).",French
"Le projet Afripédia avait notamment fait usage de ce logiciel : dans les campus universitaires d'Afrique dont la liaison internet ne disposait pas d'un débit suffisant pour permettre de consulter Wikipédia en ligne, le projet visait à la mise à disposition d'ordinateurs plug équipés de bornes Wi-Fi et d'une copie locale de Wikipédia.",French
"Kiwix est également utilisé par la Human Rights Foundation en Corée du Nord, où la version coréenne de l'encyclopédie est introduite en contrebande par des dissidents[16].",French
"Depuis 2016, des applications mobiles contenant le corpus médical de l'encyclopédie ont également fait leur apparition sous Android, toujours grâce à Kiwix, sous le nom de WikiMed.",French
"Une autre manière de consulter Wikipédia hors ligne est d'utiliser les dumps (sauvegardes), qui sont disponibles en ligne et téléchargeables par tout un chacun.",French
"Ils sont cependant particulièrement encombrants, dépassant souvent plusieurs dizaines, voire centaines de gigaoctets et nécessitent pour être utilisés une certaine compétence technique.",French
"L'accès officiel à Wikipédia se charge automatiquement sur les plateformes iPhone, Android, WebOS, Opera Mini, NetFront (Sony Mobile, PlayStation) ou Wii.",French
"Contrairement aux contributeurs anonymes, les utilisateurs inscrits peuvent modifier les articles, consulter leur liste de suivi, ajouter et enlever des articles de cette liste, etc.",French
Un bouton situé en bas de toutes les pages permet de basculer de la version bureau à la version mobile et réciproquement.,French
"Il existe également des logiciels qui permettent de transformer le contenu de Wikipédia sous forme de fichiers consultables sur des assistants personnels, comme Webaroo avec Plucker.",French
"L'appareil électronique WikiReader permet également la consultation hors-ligne de Wikipédia (en 2012, cet appareil n'est plus commercialisé en France[17]).",French
"Wikipédia peut aussi être consultée grâce à l'application Android officielle[18], disponible sur le Play Store ou encore l'application iPhone officielle[19], disponible sur l'App Store.",French
Wikipédia a pour slogan : « Le projet d'encyclopédie librement distribuable que chacun peut améliorer ».,French
Ce projet est décrit par son cofondateur Jimmy Wales comme « un effort pour créer et distribuer une encyclopédie libre de la meilleure qualité possible à chaque personne sur la planète dans sa propre langue »[20].,French
"Ainsi, Jimmy Wales proposa comme objectif que Wikipédia puisse atteindre un niveau de qualité au moins équivalent à celui de l'Encyclopædia Britannica.",French
C'est un exemple de collaboration massive à but non lucratif.,French
"En revanche, Wikipédia n'a pas pour but de présenter des informations inédites, elle ne vise donc qu'à exposer des connaissances déjà établies et reconnues, s'appuyant sur des sources secondaires de qualité[21].",French
"« Wikipédia » est un mot-valise conçu à partir de « wiki », un système de gestion de contenu de site web qui permet d'écrire facilement dans les pages consultées, et de « pédia », qui provient du mot « encyclopédie », présent dans de nombreuses langues, comme l'anglais et certaines graphies latines.",French
"Les contributeurs francophones, ainsi que ceux de certaines autres versions linguistiques, utilisent un « é » aussi bien dans le nom dactylographié que dans le Logo de Wikipédia ; la plupart des autres communautés s'en tenant à l'écriture « Wikipedia »[21].",French
Wikipédia est réalisée collaborativement sur Internet via un « réseau coopératif » autoorganisé et sans frontières linguistiques[22].,French
"Le système wiki de Wikipédia permet la création et la modification immédiates des pages par tous les visiteurs, même sans inscription.",French
"Wikipédia fut la première encyclopédie généraliste à ouvrir, grâce à ce système, la modification de ses articles à tous les internautes.",French
"Aucun article n'est considéré comme achevé, et Wikipédia se présente comme une encyclopédie en amélioration continue.",French
La constante surveillance des modifications est également ouverte à tous à travers le système wiki.,French
"Il n'y a aucun système hiérarchique de validation ; aussi l'encyclopédie est-elle l'objet de nombreuses incompréhensions et critiques quant à la qualité et à la fiabilité de son contenu[23], et l'objet d'études sur la fiabilité de Wikipédia en anglais, la langue la plus développée.",French
"Le projet se veut universel, en traitant tous les domaines de la connaissance, y compris la culture populaire[24].",French
"Il se veut aussi multilingue[25] et gratuit[26] dans sa version en ligne, afin de favoriser l'accès du plus grand nombre à la connaissance.",French
"Wikipédia est disponible sous licence libre, ce qui signifie que chacun est libre de la recopier, de la modifier[d] et de la redistribuer gratuitement et onéreusement.",French
"Cette notion de contenu libre découle de celle de logiciel libre, formulée avant Wikipédia par la Free Software Foundation.",French
"Jusqu'en 2009, le contenu textuel de Wikipédia était publié sous la Licence de documentation libre GNU (GFDL).",French
"À partir de 2009, il est principalement publié sous licence Creative Commons paternité-partage des conditions initiales à l'identique 3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0[27]), la GFDL devenant une licence secondaire disponible sous certaines conditions.",French
"Les modifications apportées par les utilisateurs sont publiées sous les deux licences, et l'import de contenu uniquement sous licence Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 est autorisé, mais il entraîne l'impossibilité de réutiliser globalement les pages concernées sous licence GFDL[e].",French
"Les autres médias (images, sons, vidéos, etc.)",French
sont disponibles sous diverses licences[f].,French
"Toutes langues confondues, des centaines de sites web reprennent tout ou partie du contenu de Wikipédia[g].",French
"Chaque site qui héberge une copie de Wikipédia a sa propre politique éditoriale ; dans Wikipédia, les contributeurs ont développé de nombreuses règles et recommandations pour viser la qualité[h].",French
"Le contenu encyclopédique se veut respectueux de la « neutralité de point de vue », définie par Jimmy Wales comme le fait de « décrire le débat plutôt que d'y participer[28] ».",French
Tout contributeur à un article de Wikipédia doit s'efforcer de ne jamais prendre parti dans une discussion argumentée qu'il rapporte.,French
"La neutralité de point de vue consiste à présenter objectivement les idées et les faits rapportés par des sources extérieures vérifiables et notoires, indépendamment des préjugés des rédacteurs des articles.",French
"Sur Wikipédia, les règles d'écriture visent à convenir aux personnes rationnelles, même si celles-ci ne sont pas toujours du même avis.",French
"La politique de neutralité de Wikipédia stipule que les articles doivent évoquer toutes les facettes d'une question controversée, et ne pas déclarer ni insinuer que l'un ou l'autre des points de vue est a priori le bon.",French
"La neutralité de point de vue n'implique pas cependant une représentation égalitaire de toutes les opinions, Wikipédia accordant plus de place aux opinions les plus largement acceptées.",French
"Par ses objectifs et son fonctionnement, le projet Wikipédia s'inscrit dans une série de filiations culturelles[2] : En revanche, Wikipédia est assez éloignée de l'Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers par sa volonté de présenter des informations neutres, alors que l'ouvrage conçu par Denis Diderot et Jean Le Rond d'Alembert se caractérisait au contraire par son fort engagement contre l'obscurantisme[32].",French
"L'historien du livre Roger Chartier souligne cependant que Wikipédia « repose sur les contributions multiples d'une sorte de société de gens de lettres invisibles » tout en observant que « Diderot n'aurait sûrement pas accepté la simple juxtaposition des articles, sans arbre des connaissances ni ordre raisonné, qui [la] caractérise »[33].",French
"Le succès de Wikipédia a poussé la communauté à développer d'autres sites en reprenant ses mécanismes de fonctionnement : Cette bibliothèque multimédia propose uniquement un contenu libre, publié soit sous licence libre[i], soit dans le domaine public aux États-Unis, dans le pays d'origine de l'œuvre, et dans celui du contributeur l'ajoutant au site.",French
"Cette banque de données regroupe la majeure partie des schémas, photos, vidéos et sons libres qui servent à illustrer les articles de Wikipédia dans ses différentes versions linguistiques.",French
"Créée le 7 septembre 2004, Wikimedia Commons dispose de plus de trente millions de fichiers début 2016.",French
Sa politique de licence libre a obligé le monde juridique à prendre position sur les droits d'auteur d'œuvres créées par des non-humains lors de la controverse du selfie du macaque[34].,French
"Wikimedia Commons collabore avec des médiathèques afin de diffuser plus largement leurs fonds d'images libres, à travers Wikipédia notamment.",French
"En décembre 2008, les archives fédérales du Bundestag allemand ont ainsi téléchargé 80 000 images vers ce site[j], puis en avril la bibliothèque du Land de Saxe fait un don de 250 000 images[k], et, en novembre 2009, le musée ethnographique d'Amsterdam Tropenmuseum a téléchargé 35 000 images concernant l'Indonésie[35].",French
"Ces images, dont beaucoup ont une valeur historique, servent ensuite d'illustrations à des articles de Wikipédia, des sites web et des journaux en ligne.",French
"Ce type de collaboration offre à ces bibliothèques et musées une plus grande diffusion de leur fonds d'images, et une révision de ces fonds par les internautes qui signalent les erreurs comme des descriptions incorrectes ou des confusions entre auteurs homonymes, et permettent la correction des autorités, les biographies succinctes identifiant les auteurs dans une collection d'archives.",French
"Wiktionary, un dictionnaire et thésaurus créé le 12 décembre 2002 ; Wikiquote, un recueil de citations (27 juin 2003) ; Wikibooks, un annuaire des livres électroniques destinés aux étudiants (10 juillet 2003) ; Wikisource, un recueil de textes dans le domaine public (23 novembre 2003) ; Wikinews, un site d'informations (décembre 2004) ; Wikispecies, un répertoire du vivant (2004) ; Wikiversity, une communauté pédagogique créée en 2006 ; et Wikivoyage, un guide touristique en ligne (octobre 2012).",French
"Créé en 2001, Meta-Wiki est un wiki utilisé pour coordonner tous ces projets, et servir à la communication entre les communautés linguistiques de Wikipédia, celles des projets frères, et la Wikimedia Foundation.",French
"Wikipédia est organisée afin de regrouper les articles rédigés dans la même langue, qui forment la version de Wikipédia dans cette langue.",French
"Les pages de Wikipédia sont regroupées dans différents espaces de noms, tels que « Principal », « Discussion », « Aide » ou encore « Utilisateur »[l].",French
"L'espace « Principal » contient les articles encyclopédiques, qui peuvent être rangés dans une ou plusieurs catégories, lesquelles peuvent être organisées selon une hiérarchisation arborescente et thématique (par exemple « Pays d'Europe », puis « Italie », puis « Ville d'Italie »)[m].",French
Les pages sont en outre reliées les unes aux autres par des hyperliens internes permettant au lecteur de se déplacer à travers l'encyclopédie[n].,French
"D'autres hyperliens permettent de naviguer entre les différentes versions linguistiques ou de conduire vers ses projets frères, par exemple pour fournir une définition d'un mot sur le Wiktionnaire ou une galerie d'images sur Wikimedia Commons[o].",French
Un clic de souris sur les illustrations de Wikipédia conduit à une page de description du fichier multimédia indiquant notamment le nom de l'auteur et la licence sous laquelle il est publié.,French
Des hyperliens externes mènent aux sources d'information en ligne venant à l'appui de l'article[p].,French
Les articles proposent aussi souvent des liens externes vers les références ou la documentation en ligne permettant d'approfondir le sujet.,French
"Ces liens sont classés en no follow (« ne pas suivre ») pour les robots d'indexation des moteurs de recherche, afin de décourager l'insertion de liens dans un but publicitaire[36].",French
"Afin d'assurer la pérennité des liens vers ces sources, Internet Archive a réparé en 2018 près de 9 millions de liens brisés[37].",French
"Sur chaque page, des onglets permettent d'accéder aux fonctions de modification, soit par l'intermédiaire d'un éditeur visuel, soit par l'intermédiaire du code source, le wikicode[q].",French
Un historique permet de lister les auteurs et de consulter les modifications successives de l'article par ses rédacteurs.,French
Ces modifications sont identifiées par l'adresse IP du rédacteur ou par son pseudonyme s'il s'est préalablement identifié[38].,French
À chaque article est rattachée une page de discussion permettant aux rédacteurs et lecteurs de discuter et de débattre de la rédaction de l'article[r].,French
"Les différentes communautés linguistiques de rédacteurs de Wikipédia ont élaboré des règles, des conventions et des principes guidant la rédaction des articles qui leur sont propres[s].",French
Mais elles respectent toutes les principes fondateurs de l'encyclopédie[t] Des passages de cet article sont désuets ou annoncent des événements désormais passés.,French
Améliorez-le ou discutez-en.,French
Vous pouvez également préciser les sections à actualiser en utilisant {{section à actualiser}}.,French
"Des analyses statistiques, menées par des chercheurs de l'université Carnegie-Mellon et du Palo Alto Research Center, étudient l'état de la couverture thématique de Wikipédia en anglais en janvier 2008[39].",French
La répartition montre une nette prédominance des articles culturels.,French
"Les pourcentages qui suivent sont ceux de janvier 2008, les variations entre parenthèses représentent leur évolution depuis juillet 2006.",French
"Dans l'intervalle, le nombre de pages et de catégories a plus que doublé : La Wikimedia Foundation permet aux différentes versions linguistiques de Wikipédia d'héberger directement du contenu multimédia (images, vidéo, cartes, plans, sons...).",French
Elle incite néanmoins les différentes communautés à déplacer le contenu libre vers une plate-forme multimédia commune à l'ensemble des 303 versions linguistiques de Wikipédia : Wikimedia Commons.,French
"Cependant, de nombreuses images (celles dont le statut vis-à-vis du droit d'auteur varie selon les pays, ou celles qui sont protégées par des copyrights incompatibles avec un téléversement sous licence ouverte) n'y sont pas acceptées.",French
"Chaque version linguistique s'est dotée de critères spécifiques et d'une doctrine réglementant l'hébergement de contenu non libre, comme des illustrations protégées par le droit d'auteur mais publiées grâce à des exceptions présentes dans certaines législations[u].",French
"Par exemple, Wikipédia en anglais a adopté le principe américain du fair use[40] (« usage raisonnable », en français), contrairement à Wikipédia en français[41].",French
"Afin d'augmenter le nombre d'images libres disponibles pour illustrer les articles, le concours photographique international Wiki Loves Earth propose de prendre des photos ayant pour sujet le Patrimoine naturel, puis à les téléverser dans le répertoire Wikimedia Commons.",French
Wikimédia Commons héberge plus de 56 millions d'images[42].,French
"Depuis sa création, le contenu de l'encyclopédie Wikipédia n’a cessé de grandir, en quantité, dans des proportions difficilement imaginables à ses débuts.",French
"Au départ comparable aux autres encyclopédies existantes, elle les a rapidement dépassées en taille et en couverture[43].",French
"Wikipédia est l'un des sites les plus fréquentés au monde, avec plus de 600 millions de visites quotidiennes[44].",French
"Il constitue le plus grand et le plus populaire des ouvrages de références générales d'Internet, avec un total de 160 millions de pages disponibles[45].",French
"Ainsi, fin 2009, Wikipédia contenait déjà 28,5 millions d'articles, auxquels il convenait d'ajouter les documents de la médiathèque Wikimedia Commons, contenant 5,6 millions de fichiers.",French
Ces documents étaient chaque mois consultés par 346 millions de visiteurs uniques[46].,French
Le dessin 3D ci-dessous illustre cette volumétrie.,French
"En 2015, une image 3D de la même volumétrie 2009, reprenant une étude menée par Jacopo Farina et ses collègues[47], a été réalisée à l'aide du logiciel Minecraft[43].",French
Wikipédia est un projet multilingue composé de près de 300 projets linguistiques distincts[48].,French
Chaque version linguistique est gérée par des communautés de bénévoles différentes et bénéficie d'une certaine autonomie de fonctionnement.,French
Les règles d'édition peuvent par exemple varier d'une version linguistique à l'autre.,French
"Au total, l'ensemble des versions linguistiques représente des milliards de modifications sur des dizaines de millions de pages encyclopédiques, construites par des centaines de milliers de contributeurs.",French
Une liste des Wikipédias actualisée régulièrement est disponible sur le site Méta-Wiki.,French
"Certaines éditions de Wikipédia, telles que les éditions en cebuano et en waray-waray, ont un nombre d'articles très élevé malgré un nombre limité d'utilisateurs, en raison de l'utilisation d'un logiciel ou robot pour générer des articles[49].",French
Il existe également un classement qualitatif fondé sur l'existence et la taille des articles d'une liste arbitraire d'environ 1 000 articles que toute édition de Wikipédia devrait avoir[w].,French
"Le projet Wikipédia ne se limite pas aux langues vivantes comptant un très grand nombre de locuteurs, officielles ou attachées à un pays.",French
"En effet, des versions de l’encyclopédie Wikipédia sont rédigées dans les langues corse, occitane, bretonne, picarde, basque, catalane, latine, en espéranto, en anglais simplifié.",French
"Sept versions linguistiques de l'encyclopédie recourent à l'orthographe et à la typographie « Wikipédia » (avec l'accent aigu) pour désigner l'encyclopédie : Les trois éditions de Wikipédia les plus consultées mi‑2010 sont, d'après le site d'Alexa (Internet), la version en anglais avec 54 % du trafic, la version en japonais avec 10,3 % du trafic et la version en allemand avec 8,1 % du trafic.",French
"Depuis juillet 2020, Abstract Wikipedia est un projet de la Fondation Wikimedia qui vise à créer une version indépendante d'une langue de Wikipédia, en utilisant des données structurées provenant de Wikidata[50].",French
Tout lecteur de Wikipédia est un rédacteur ou correcteur potentiel.,French
"Fin 2008, un sondage est effectué par la Wikimedia Foundation et UNU-MERIT.",French
"Environ 130 000 lecteurs et contributeurs de Wikipédia y ont répondu, principalement en langues anglaise, allemande et espagnole.",French
La moyenne d'âge des sondés est environ 26 ans.,French
"Une fois les résultats lissés, environ 65 % d'entre eux se déclaraient seulement lecteurs, et 35 % contributeurs.",French
"Parmi les contributeurs, 48 % d'entre eux avaient fait des études supérieures, et 20 % obtenu un master ou plus.",French
"Ces contributeurs passent en moyenne 4,3 heures par semaine sur Wikipédia, et leurs motivations principales sont de partager le savoir et de corriger les erreurs[51].",French
"Certains comptes utilisateurs sont utilisés par des logiciels, dits « robots » ou « bots », programmés pour assurer la maintenance des articles, par exemple pour corriger des erreurs communes d'orthographe ou de mise en forme, lutter contre les vandalismes ou encore, dans certaines éditions de Wikipédia, créer de nombreux nouveaux articles[49],[52].",French
"En 2014, les robots ont effectué près de 15 % de l'ensemble des contributions[53].",French
"Il leur arrive de mener des « guerres d'édition » entre eux, parfois pendant plusieurs années[54].",French
"Les rédacteurs se répartissent généralement par communauté linguistique concentrée sur la rédaction de la version de Wikipédia correspondante, mais interviennent aussi souvent ponctuellement sur les versions de Wikipédia en d'autres langues, ou les projets frères de la Wikimedia Foundation.",French
"Depuis 2008, les comptes enregistrés peuvent être unifiés : un seul compte sert ainsi à identifier l'utilisateur sur tous les projets de la Wikimedia Foundation.",French
"Parmi les contributeurs, il y a toujours eu plus d'hommes que de femmes[55].",French
"En 2010, une étude réalisée à partir d'une enquête auprès des contributeurs et contributrices et des travaux antérieurs sur le genre, l'expérience de l'internet et les compétences à contribuer suggère que ceci est dû en partie au fait que les hommes ont de manière générale plus développé certaines des compétences utiles dans l'Internet pour contribuer à ce type de projet[56],[57].",French
Un contributeur est classé « actif » tant qu'il fait au moins cinq modifications par mois.,French
"Depuis 2007, le nombre de contributeurs actifs sur l'ensemble des versions linguistiques de Wikipédia a presque été divisé par deux[58].",French
"Un rédacteur peut être identifié par son adresse IP, ou par son pseudonyme s'il l'a enregistré sur le site.",French
"Plus de 85 millions d'éditeurs ont créé leur compte, 300 000 étant considérés comme actifs[59].",French
"Au sein de Wikipédia, les comptes utilisateurs disposent de différents statuts techniques gérés par le logiciel MediaWiki et contrôlant les actions qui leur sont permises[x].",French
Les critères pour acquérir un statut et la façon de se servir des capacités fournies sont fixés indépendamment par chaque communauté.,French
"Parmi ces statuts, les principaux sont : La Wikimedia Foundation fournit des statistiques mensuelles sur son site[z].",French
"On trouve notamment la somme des nombres de contributeurs ayant fait au moins 100 modifications pour l'ensemble des éditions[60] : On trouve également la somme des nombres de contributeurs ayant fait au moins 5 modifications pour l'ensemble des éditions[61] : On trouve également le nombre de pages vues pour l'ensemble des éditions[62] : Les modifications apportées aux articles font l'objet de plusieurs niveaux de surveillance a posteriori, qui permettent de corriger les erreurs les plus évidentes.",French
"Selon Le Figaro, le cofondateur de Wikipédia, Jimmy Wales, affirme ainsi qu'« en général, la correction d'une erreur ou d'une information fallacieuse a lieu en quelques heures, voire en quelques minutes »[63].",French
"Une étude de l'université du Minnesota affirme que, jusqu'en 2006, sur deux millions de modifications problématiques, 42 % ont été réparées dans un temps qui rend peu probable leur lecture par un visiteur, alors qu'environ 11 % des vandalismes détectés persistaient après avoir été vus cent fois.",French
"De la même manière, la grande majorité des vandalismes détectés avaient été corrigés après 15 révisions au plus[64].",French
"En 2009, Dominique Cardon et Julien Levrel attribuent une partie de la réussite du mode de correction et du processus d'amélioration continue de Wikipédia à une gouvernance fondée sur la « vigilance participative »[65].",French
"À un premier niveau, tous les changements sont accessibles en temps réel sur une page récapitulant les « modifications récentes ».",French
"Ce flux est scruté en permanence par des volontaires, ainsi que par quelques automates[66].",French
"Les vandalismes les plus évidents (écrasements de pages entières, messages d'insulte, graffiti) sont généralement détectés à ce stade, et corrigés dans les secondes ou minutes qui suivent par un retour à la version précédente.",French
Ce premier niveau de contrôle porte essentiellement sur la forme.,French
"Les surveillants volontaires peuvent également corriger des problèmes évidents d'orthographe ou de style, et éventuellement effectuer un contrôle de cohérence rapide sur un ajout particulièrement suspect.",French
"En 2006, 60 % des « vandalismes » étaient détectés facilement par des humains (modifications dénuées de sens, offensantes ou encore suppressions massives), mais certaines catégories de modifications semblaient plus délicates à repérer : désinformation, suppression partielle, spam et autres[64].",French
"Le deuxième niveau de contrôle consiste, pour un rédacteur inscrit, à examiner sur sa « liste de suivi » (liste des pages qu'il a marquées pour les surveiller) les modifications apportées récemment.",French
"Cet examen permet de détecter et corriger assez rapidement les principaux problèmes de fond : erreurs manifestes, ajouts hors sujet, ou manque d'objectivité ou de neutralité dans la formulation.",French
"Les coauteurs de l'article peuvent ainsi contrôler de manière plus approfondie les ajouts suspects, si nécessaire en s'appuyant sur des sources de référence.",French
"Quand ces deux premiers niveaux de contrôle conduisent à des corrections, le correcteur volontaire peut examiner ensuite l'ensemble des ajouts effectués par le même contributeur, ce qui peut lui permettre de rattraper des modifications ayant échappé aux deux premiers niveaux de contrôle.",French
"Quand il apparaît qu'un contributeur « à problème » a trop souvent une contribution négative sur Wikipédia, il peut se faire interdire d'écriture sur toute l'encyclopédie : « Les administrateurs, élus parmi les contributeurs, ont le pouvoir de supprimer ou de protéger des pages, de bloquer ou d'exclure un contributeur à la suite d'une décision du comité d'arbitrage, lui aussi composé de membres choisis par la communauté »[63].",French
"Les erreurs qui échappent à ces premiers niveaux de contrôle sont des erreurs peu évidentes, ou qui portent sur des articles marginaux, de faible avancement, et peu surveillés.",French
"Ces erreurs peuvent rester des mois voire des années dans l'article, et restent d'autant plus longtemps que l'article est peu lu et peu modifié[63].",French
Elles peuvent être corrigées spontanément par un lecteur.,French
"De plus, à la faveur d'une nouvelle modification, l'article repasse par les contrôles précédents, et les correcteurs volontaires peuvent décider à cette occasion de le relire en intégralité pour corriger d'éventuelles erreurs anciennes.",French
"Le dernier niveau de contrôle, collectif, est formé par les projets d'amélioration d'articles rattachés à un thème donné, organisé autour d'un « portail ».",French
"Dans ce cadre, les articles sont relus, complétés et corrigés, par des volontaires passionnés par ce thème.",French
"Les articles qui bénéficient de ces relectures sont initialement corrigés, et continuent généralement à être suivis par l'équipe du « portail ».[réf.",French
"nécessaire] Chaque communauté établit aussi des procédures pour labelliser les articles en fonction de critères spécifiques, ce processus conduit par exemple à deux catégories d'articles : « bon article »[aa] (« good article » sur Wikipédia en anglais) et « article de qualité »[ab] (« featured article » sur Wikipédia en anglais).",French
"D'autres procédures sont développées et testées par les différentes communautés de langue, comme le projet WikiTrust, des filtres automatiques contrôlant le texte proposé à la publication, ou des versions de travail nécessitant une relecture avant d'être incorporés à la version publiée (flagged revision)[réf.",French
souhaitée].,French
"L'étude menée par des chercheurs de l'université Carnegie-Mellon et du Palo Alto Research Center sur l'année 2008[39] s'intéresse également à la contribution des différents thèmes de l'encyclopédie aux conflits, en décomptant le nombre d'annulations de modification, ramené à la taille de la catégorie correspondant au thème : Les annulations de modification sont plus nombreuses dans certains articles, dont l'ensemble ou une partie du contenu se trouve particulièrement controversé.",French
Une étude montre que ces articles diffèrent selon les langues de l'encyclopédie[67].,French
"Dans l'encyclopédie Wikipédia en français, les dix articles les plus controversés selon le critère des annulations, étaient à fin mars 2010, les suivants : Le statut de Wikipédia en tant que source de référence est un sujet de controverses, en particulier à cause de son système de rédaction ouvert à tous.",French
L'audience grandissante de Wikipédia a conduit un grand nombre de personnes à formuler des avis critiques sur la fiabilité des informations présentées dans cette encyclopédie.,French
"Ces critiques étant récurrentes, une page spéciale de Wikipédia est consacrée aux réponses de participants à Wikipédia aux objections les plus fréquentes[ac].",French
"Les principales critiques portent sur : Les critiques de Wikipédia l'accusent d'incohérences, de partialité systémique et d'une forme d'anti-élitisme[68], et d'avoir une politique favorisant trop le consensus dans son processus éditorial[69].",French
La fiabilité et la précision de Wikipédia sont aussi des questions débattues[70].,French
"D'autres critiques portent essentiellement sur sa sensibilité au vandalisme et à l'ajout de fausses informations[71], bien que des travaux aient suggéré que le vandalisme est généralement de courte durée[72],[64].",French
D'autres critiques se révèlent plutôt positives.,French
"Ainsi, en juin 2009, le philosophe français Bernard Stiegler estime que Wikipédia, « passage obligé pour tout utilisateur d'Internet », est un « exemple frappant d'économie de la contribution » et que l'encyclopédie « a conçu un système d'intelligence collective en réseau »[73].",French
"Des études ont été menées sur la qualité du contenu proposée par Wikipédia, et des comparaisons effectuées avec d'autres encyclopédies.",French
"Ces évaluations fournissent généralement des conclusions positives pour Wikipédia, mais ces résultats font aussi l'objet de critiques[74].",French
"Le traitement inégalitaire des hommes et des femmes tant en nombre d'articles qu'en qualité et neutralité du contenu, avec une présentation des femmes plus péjorative, fait l'objet d'analyses convergentes[75],[76],[77],[78].",French
"Toutefois, les études ne concluent pas sur le fait de savoir si ce biais provient des contributeurs eux-mêmes, ou des sources qui leur sont disponibles[75].",French
"En 2017, la journée internationale des droits des femmes du 8 mars a vu de nombreuses initiatives pour améliorer le nombre d'articles consacrés à des personnalités féminines[79],[80],[81],[82].",French
"En octobre 2018, lors de l'attribution du Nobel de physique à Donna Strickland, son absence de Wikipédia fait réagir et suscite certaines critiques sur la représentativité des femmes dans l'encyclopédie, tout en pointant du doigt la responsabilité des médias et universitaires qui n'avaient pas préalablement donné de couverture « significative et durable » à cette chercheuse[83].",French
Une critique souvent formulée par la communauté transgenre est la transphobie de la communauté anglophone de Wikipédia[84].,French
"Le refus de l'utilisation de sources primaires peut notamment mener à utiliser les deadnames ou à ne pas respecter l'identité de genre d'une personne, ce qui relève de la transphobie[85],[86].",French
La version de Wikipedia en anglais dispose de conventions de style à propos de l'identité de genre qui préconisent que l'article doit utiliser l'identité de genre exprimée par le sujet de l'article (dans la source la plus récente)[86].,French
"Toutefois, il est à souligner que le magazine Marianne rappelle qu'en quelques heures, ""Ellen"" a été remplacé par ""Elliot"" dans les titres d'articles, sur la fiche wikipédia de Elliot Page[87].",French
La Wikimedia Foundation a fait part de son inquiétude quant au départ de personnes contribuant à Wikipédia en raison de harcèlement lié à leur identité de genre[86].,French
"Par conséquent, Wikipedia adopte un code de conduite pour lutter contre le harcèlement suite aux problèmes comportementaux de certains de ses éditeurs qui aux fils de discussion tournent au pugilat voire au harcèlement par un membre de la communauté à l’encontre d’autres, notamment à l’encontre des femmes, des personnes de la communauté LGBT, etc.",French
"Jusqu’à ce que le conseil d’administration en vienne à suspendre un administrateur pendant un an, et ce, à l’encontre de la tradition de la communauté qui règle généralement ses problèmes de manière collégiale[88].",French
Wikipédia et ses projets parallèles sont des wikis libres.,French
"Le premier wiki est créé en 1995 par Ward Cunningham, qui l'appelle WikiWikiWeb[ad].",French
"Un wiki est un site web dynamique, dont les visiteurs autorisés peuvent modifier les pages qu'ils lisent avec leur navigateur web.",French
"Sur Wikipédia, par exemple, la syntaxe utilisée pour modifier une page est beaucoup plus simple que celle du Hypertext Markup Language, et elle est censée permettre un apprentissage rapide.",French
"Le fonctionnement de Wikipédia est assuré par le logiciel libre MediaWiki, une plate-forme wiki adaptée à Wikipédia, écrite en PHP et utilisant une base de données MySQL.",French
MediaWiki est sous licence GNU GPL et est en 2010 utilisé par tous les projets Wikimedia ainsi que par de nombreux autres sites wikis.,French
"À l'origine, Wikipédia utilisait le logiciel UseModWiki, développé par Clifford Adams en Perl, et requérant l'usage de la camel case pour la création de liens entre les articles.",French
"À partir de janvier 2002, la version en anglais de Wikipédia utilise un logiciel développé par Magnus Manske, écrit en PHP — les versions dans les autres langues étant restées sous le logiciel UseModWiki.",French
"À partir de l'été 2002, tous les sites sont progressivement migrés vers MediaWiki.",French
"Les informations contenues dans Wikipédia, toutes langues confondues, sont conservées dans une base de données et peuvent être téléchargées[ae].",French
Le succès croissant de Wikipédia nécessite l'emploi d'un grand nombre de serveurs informatiques qui fonctionnent tous avec un système d'exploitation GNU/Linux (principalement Ubuntu)[89].,French
"Ces installations sont présentes à Tampa en Floride, à Amsterdam aux Pays-Bas, et dans le site sud-coréen d'hébergement de Yahoo!",French
qui accueille 23 serveurs[Quand ?],French
de la Wikimedia Foundation.,French
"Les serveurs sont organisés en trois couches : Plusieurs sites web, comme Ganglia[af], permettent de consulter diverses informations sur le fonctionnement des serveurs, notamment la charge des processeurs, la mémoire occupée… Une description précise de l'architecture des serveurs est difficile, car elle change très fréquemment en raison des améliorations régulièrement apportées pour répondre au très fort trafic engendré par la consultation de Wikipédia.",French
Cet aspect de Wikipédia est géré par le personnel technique de la Wikimedia Foundation.,French
"La Wikimedia Foundation possède les différentes marques (Wikipedia, Wikimedia…), les serveurs, les sites web, et agit comme hébergeur web.",French
"Des associations nationales, ayant pour but de promouvoir Wikipédia et le libre partage des connaissances, existent dans plusieurs pays.",French
"Elles reprennent généralement l'intitulé « Wikimedia » (Wikimédia Belgique, Wikimédia France[ag], Wikimédia Suisse[ah], etc.).",French
"Ces associations sont reconnues comme associations locales par la Wikimedia Foundation, mais n'y sont pas juridiquement liées, et n'ont aucune responsabilité sur le contenu de Wikipédia.",French
Elles sont généralement désignées comme le chapter (chapitre) pour un pays donné.,French
"Des associations de ce type sont présentes en Angleterre, en Allemagne, en Argentine, en Australie, en Autriche, en France, à Hong Kong, en Israël, en Italie, aux Pays-Bas, en Pologne, en République tchèque, en Russie, en Serbie, en Suède, en Suisse et à Taïwan[91].",French
Les différentes communautés linguistiques et la Wikimedia Foundation s'accordent pour publier Wikipédia et ses projets frères sans recourir à un financement publicitaire[réf.,French

"Soutenue uniquement par des dons des lecteurs, de mécènes et de fondations, la Wikimedia Foundation emploie une trentaine de personnes[ai] (en septembre 2014, 213 noms constituent l'équipe Wikimédia[92]), principalement des techniciens gérant les serveurs hébergeant les différents sites.",French
"Pour l'année fiscale 2007-2008, elle a reçu 6,4 millions de dollars US[aj] de dons.",French
"Selon comScore, Wikipédia a acquis une influence mondiale[93].",French
"Selon comScore et Alexa (Internet), Wikipédia figure depuis 2007 parmi les dix sites les plus visités dans le monde et le seul site non-commercial[94].",French
"La croissance de Wikipédia a été favorisée par son classement dans les résultats d'une recherche sur Google[95], environ 50 % du trafic des moteurs de recherche vers Wikipédia provenant de Google[96], dont une grande partie est liée à la recherche universitaire[97].",French
"En avril 2007, le Pew Internet and American Life Project a constaté que le tiers des internautes américains consultaient Wikipédia[98].",French
"En octobre 2006, le site a été estimé à une valeur de marché hypothétique de 580 millions de dollars américains s'il y avait des publicités[99].",French
"En juillet 2007, Wikipédia a fait l'objet d'un documentaire de 30 minutes sur la BBC Radio 4[100], qui affirmait que « Wikipédia » était devenu un terme connu par tout le monde, au même titre que « Google », « Facebook » et « YouTube ».",French
"Le cinéaste néerlandais IJsbrand van Veelen a créé un documentaire télévisé de 45 minutes en avril 2008, The Truth According to Wikipedia[101].",French

"Dans un communiqué de presse du 10 novembre 2009, Wikimedia Foundation annonce recevoir plus de 320 millions de visiteurs par mois pour Wikipédia et ses projets frères, d'après comScore Media Metrix[104].",French
De nombreux projets d'encyclopédie existent — ou ont déjà existé — sur Internet.,French
"Certains, tels que la Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy[ak] ou la défunte Nupedia, ont adopté une politique éditoriale traditionnelle, avec par exemple un seul auteur par article.",French
"La forte fréquentation de Wikipédia, combinée aux critiques sur son principe de fonctionnement, ont également poussé au développement de projets concurrents.",French
Citizendium est par exemple une encyclopédie en ligne en anglais dirigée par Larry Sanger et publiée sous licence libre.,French
Elle se distingue notamment par l'obligation pour les rédacteurs d'indiquer leur nom et de préciser leurs diplômes.,French
"Le 5 décembre 2009, Citizendium propose 12 790 articles, dont 121 ont été approuvés par son système de sélection.",French
"À titre de comparaison et à la même date, Wikipédia en anglais propose 3 116 306 articles, dont 2 710 sont présentés comme articles de qualité (featured articles).",French
"L'exemple de Wikipédia a aussi suscité la création de projets plus spécialisés, comme l'encyclopédie thématique Memory Alpha, consacrée à l'univers de Star Trek, ou le site parodique Désencyclopédie.",French
"Également inspirée de Wikipédia[105], Wikimini et Vikidia offrent un dessein pédagogique à ces nouveaux wikis en proposant aux enfants et adolescents de construire leur propre encyclopédie en ligne[106].",French
"D'autres, tels que Susning[al] et l'Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español, sont des wikis dans lesquels les articles sont écrits par divers collaborateurs sans processus formel de révision.",French
"Conservapedia est une encyclopédie collaborative en ligne en anglais, conservatrice et créationniste, construite en réaction à la neutralité de point de vue de Wikipédia en anglais, jugée trop « gauchiste » » et « liberal » (au sens américain du terme)[107].",French
"Le projet Wikipédia a aussi influencé la création d'une encyclopédie d'extrême droite qui se dit « encyclopédie alternative », Metapedia, créée le 26 octobre 2006 en suédois, puis son pendant slave, Wikislavia.",French

"En 2015, une étude sur l'usage de Wikipédia dans l'enseignement français montre une utilisation accrue de l'encyclopédie participative en tant que ressource par les enseignants et les élèves[152],[153].",French
"Lors du Forum du numérique éducatif organisé pour les enseignants dans les locaux de l'Insa de Blois, un intervenant a rappelé la pertinence de Wikipédia à longue échéance dans les établissements scolaires, en particulier en vue de montrer aux élèves comment se construit le savoir[154].",French
"L'ensemble des prix décernés à Wikipédia peut être vu sur Wikipédia:Meta, sur la page Trophy shelf.",French
Wikipédia a reçu deux prix en mai 2004.,French
"Le premier était un Golden Nica (en) pour les communautés numériques, qui fut remis par Ars Electronica avec la somme de 10 000 € et une invitation à se présenter au PAE Cyberarts Festival en Autriche, plus tard dans l'année.",French
"Le deuxième était un Webby Awards dans la catégorie « communauté », remis par l'International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, basée à New York[155].",French
Wikipédia a également été proposée pour un Webby Award dans la catégorie « meilleures pratiques ».,French
"En septembre 2004, la version japonaise de Wikipédia a reçu le Web Creation Award de la part de l'Association des publicitaires japonais.",French
"Cette récompense, normalement donnée à des personnes réelles pour de grandes contributions sur le web en japonais, fut acceptée par un contributeur de longue date de Wikipedia en japonais.",French
"Le 26 janvier 2007, « Wikipédia » a aussi été nommée quatrième meilleure marque par les lecteurs de brandchannel, recevant 15 % des voix en réponse à la question « Quelle marque a le plus d'impact sur nos vies en 2006[156] ?",French
"» En septembre 2008, Wikipédia a reçu le prix Quadriga 2008, également attribué à Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling (en) et Peter Gabriel.",French
Le prix a été décerné à Jimmy Wales par David Weinberger (en)[157].,French
"En 2009, les Webby Awards classent la création de Wikipédia en 2001 comme l'un des « moments les plus importants de la vie du web ces dix dernières années »[158].",French
"En janvier 2013, l'astéroïde (274301) Wikipédia est nommé en l'honneur de l'encyclopédie[159].",French

Wikipédia est financée par les dons d'internautes consultant l'encyclopédie.,French
"Wikipedia organise une collecte de fonds annuelle, annoncée par des bandeaux présents sur chaque page sous forme d'« appels » de Jimmy Wales ou de divers contributeurs.",French
"Bien que les fonds reçus soient chaque année plus élevés que l'année précédente[164], ils ne suffisent pas forcément à équilibrer le budget de la Wikimedia Foundation, qui héberge Wikipédia, selon les rapports financiers.",French
L'argent nécessaire au budget est comblé par les dons de diverses institutions ou entreprises et ceux reçus par des particuliers le reste de l'année[165].,French
"Google puis Amazon, qui exploitent le contenu de l'encyclopédie, sont les deux premiers géants du Web, respectivement en 2017 et 2018, à apporter un don à Wikipédia, à chaque fois d'un montant d'un million de dollars[166].",French
"Contrairement à un grand nombre de sites, Wikipedia refuse d'afficher de la publicité pour financer son fonctionnement.",French
"Selon certaines méthodes d'évaluation en 2013, le coût de remplacement de Wikipedia pourrait être estimé à 6,6 milliards de dollars avec 630 millions de dollars de frais de mise à jour par an ; et le bénéfice de Wikipédia pour l’utilisateur serait estimé à des centaines de milliards de dollars[167].",French
"L'utilisation de l'informatique contribue à l'augmentation de l'énergie grise, et les consultations/modifications concourent à la consommation directe d'énergie.",French
"En 2018, les serveurs de la Wikimedia Foundation, qui hébergent les données des différentes Wikipédias, n'étaient alimentés par des sources d'énergie renouvelables qu'à hauteur de 6 % et ont envoyé dans l'atmosphère 1,2 kilotonne de CO2.",French
"Cela équivaut aux émissions de 1 000 voitures parcourant 10 000 km par an, à raison de 120 g d'émissions de CO2 par km.",French
"À la suite de l'accord de Paris sur le climat en 2015, la Fondation Wikimedia a décidé de lancer une initiative durabilité (sustainability initiative) pour réduire les impacts environnementaux de ses activités.",French
La Fondation Wikimedia a aussi décidé de réaliser chaque année une étude sur ses impacts environnementaux[168].,French
"Sur les autres projets Wikimedia : modifier - modifier le code - modifier Wikidata L'apprentissage automatique[1],[2] (en anglais : machine learning, litt.",French
"« apprentissage machine[1],[2] »), apprentissage artificiel[1] ou apprentissage statistique est un  champ d'étude de l'intelligence artificielle qui se fonde sur des approches mathématiques et statistiques pour donner aux ordinateurs la capacité d'« apprendre » à partir de données, c'est-à-dire d'améliorer leurs performances à résoudre des tâches sans être explicitement programmés pour chacune.",French
"Plus largement, il concerne la conception, l'analyse, l'optimisation, le développement et l'implémentation de telles méthodes.",French
L'apprentissage automatique comporte généralement deux phases.,French
"La première consiste à estimer un modèle à partir de données, appelées observations, qui sont disponibles et en nombre fini, lors de la phase de conception du système.",French
"L'estimation du modèle consiste à résoudre une tâche pratique, telle que traduire un discours, estimer une densité de probabilité, reconnaître la présence d'un chat dans une photographie ou participer à la conduite d'un véhicule autonome.",French
Cette phase dite « d'apprentissage » ou « d'entraînement » est généralement réalisée préalablement à l'utilisation pratique du modèle.,French
"La seconde phase correspond à la mise en production : le modèle étant déterminé, de nouvelles données peuvent alors être soumises afin d'obtenir le résultat correspondant à la tâche souhaitée.",French
"En pratique, certains systèmes peuvent poursuivre leur apprentissage une fois en production, pour peu qu'ils aient un moyen d'obtenir un retour sur la qualité des résultats produits.",French
"Selon les informations disponibles durant la phase d'apprentissage, l'apprentissage est qualifié de différentes manières.",French
"Si les données sont étiquetées (c'est-à-dire que la réponse à la tâche est connue pour ces données), il s'agit d'un apprentissage supervisé.",French
"On parle de classification ou de classement[3] si les étiquettes sont discrètes, ou de régression si elles sont continues.",French
"Si le modèle est appris de manière incrémentale en fonction d'une récompense reçue par le programme pour chacune des actions entreprises, on parle d'apprentissage par renforcement.",French
"Dans le cas le plus général, sans étiquette, on cherche à déterminer la structure sous-jacente des données (qui peuvent être une densité de probabilité) et il s'agit alors d'apprentissage non supervisé.",French
"L'apprentissage automatique peut être appliqué à différents types de données, tels des graphes, des arbres, des courbes, ou plus simplement des vecteurs de caractéristiques, qui peuvent être continues ou discrètes.",French
"Depuis l'antiquité, le sujet des machines pensantes préoccupe les esprits.",French
"Ce concept est la base de pensées pour ce qui deviendra ensuite l'intelligence artificielle, ainsi qu'une de ses sous-branches : l'apprentissage automatique.",French
"La concrétisation de cette idée est principalement due à Alan Turing (mathématicien et cryptologue britannique) et à son concept de la « machine universelle » en 1936[4], qui est à la base des ordinateurs d'aujourd'hui.",French
"Il continuera à poser les bases de l'apprentissage automatique, avec son article sur « L'ordinateur et l'intelligence » en 1950[5], dans lequel il développe, entre autres, le test de Turing.",French
"En 1943, le neurophysiologiste Warren McCulloch et le mathématicien Walter Pitts publient un article décrivant le fonctionnement de neurones en les représentant à l'aide de circuits électriques.",French
Cette représentation sera la base théorique des réseaux neuronaux[6].,French
"Arthur Samuel, informaticien américain pionnier dans le secteur de l'intelligence artificielle, est le premier à faire usage de l'expression machine learning (en français, « apprentissage automatique ») en 1959 à la suite de la création de son programme pour IBM en 1952.",French
Le programme jouait au Jeu de Dames et s'améliorait en jouant.,French
"À terme, il parvint à battre le 4e meilleur joueur des États-Unis[7],[8].",French
"Une avancée majeure dans le secteur de l'intelligence machine est le succès de l'ordinateur développé par IBM, Deep Blue, qui est le premier à vaincre le champion mondial d'échecs Garry Kasparov en 1997.",French
"Le projet Deep Blue en inspirera nombre d'autres dans le cadre de l'intelligence artificielle, particulièrement un autre grand défi : IBM Watson, l'ordinateur dont le but est de gagner au jeu Jeopardy![9].",French
"Ce but est atteint en 2011, quand Watson gagne à Jeopardy!",French
en répondant aux questions par traitement de langage naturel[10].,French
"Durant les années suivantes, les applications de l'apprentissage automatique médiatisées se succèdent bien plus rapidement qu'auparavant.",French
"En 2012, un réseau neuronal développé par Google parvient à reconnaître des visages humains ainsi que des chats dans des vidéos YouTube[11],[12].",French
"En 2014, 64 ans après la prédiction d'Alan Turing, le dialogueur Eugene Goostman est le premier à réussir le test de Turing en parvenant à convaincre 33 % des juges humains au bout de cinq minutes de conversation qu'il est non pas un ordinateur, mais un garçon ukrainien de 13 ans[13].",French
"En 2015, une nouvelle étape importante est atteinte lorsque l'ordinateur « AlphaGo » de Google gagne contre un des meilleurs joueurs au jeu de Go, jeu de plateau considéré comme le plus dur du monde[14].",French
"En 2016, un système d'intelligence artificielle à base d'apprentissage automatique nommé LipNet parvient à lire sur les lèvres avec un grand taux de succès[15],[16].",French
"Les algorithmes utilisés permettent, dans une certaine mesure, à un système piloté par ordinateur (un robot éventuellement), ou assisté par ordinateur, d'adapter ses analyses et ses comportements en réponse, en se fondant sur l'analyse de données empiriques provenant d'une base de données ou de capteurs.",French
La difficulté réside dans le fait que l'ensemble de tous les comportements possibles compte tenu de toutes les entrées possibles devient rapidement trop complexe à décrire (on parle d'explosion combinatoire).,French
On confie donc à des programmes le soin d'ajuster un modèle pour simplifier cette complexité et de l'utiliser de manière opérationnelle.,French
"Idéalement, l'apprentissage visera à être non supervisé, c'est-à-dire que la nature des données d'entrainement n'est pas connue[17].",French
"Ces programmes, selon leur degré de perfectionnement, intègrent éventuellement des capacités de traitement probabiliste des données, d'analyse de données issues de capteurs, de reconnaissance (reconnaissance vocale, de forme, d'écriture…), de fouille de données, d'informatique théorique… L'apprentissage automatique est utilisé pour doter des ordinateurs ou des machines de systèmes de : perception de leur environnement (vision, reconnaissance d'objets tels des visages, schémas, langages naturels, caractères manuscrits, formes)  ; moteurs de recherche ; aide aux diagnostics, médical notamment, bio-informatique, chémoinformatique ; interfaces cerveau-machine ; détection de fraudes à la carte de crédit, cybersécurité, analyse financière, dont analyse du marché boursier ; classification des séquences d'ADN ; jeu ; génie logiciel ; adaptation de sites Web ; locomotion de robots ; analyse prédictive en matière juridique et judiciaire… Exemples : Les algorithmes d'apprentissage peuvent se catégoriser selon le mode d'apprentissage qu'ils emploient : Ce sont, dans ce domaine : Ces méthodes sont souvent combinées pour obtenir diverses variantes d'apprentissage.",French
"L'utilisation de tel ou tel algorithme dépend fortement de la tâche à résoudre (classification, estimation de valeurs…).",French
"L'apprentissage automatique est utilisé pour un large spectre d'applications, par exemple : La qualité de l'apprentissage et de l'analyse dépendent du besoin en amont et a priori de la compétence de l'opérateur pour préparer l'analyse.",French
"Elle dépend aussi de la complexité du modèle (spécifique ou généraliste), de son adéquation et de son adaptation au sujet à traiter.",French
"In fine, la qualité du travail dépendra aussi du mode (de mise en évidence visuelle) des résultats pour l'utilisateur final (un résultat pertinent pourrait être caché dans un schéma trop complexe, ou mal mis en évidence par une représentation graphique inappropriée).",French
"Avant cela, la qualité du travail dépendra de facteurs initiaux contraignants, liées à la base de données : L'apprentissage automatique ne se résume pas à un ensemble d'algorithmes mais suit une succession d'étapes[25].",French
L’apprentissage automatique demande de grandes quantités de données pour fonctionner correctement.,French
"Il peut s’avérer difficile de contrôler l’intégrité des jeux de données, notamment dans le cas de données générées par les réseaux sociaux[26].",French
"La qualité des « décisions » prises par un algorithme d’AA dépend non seulement de la qualité (donc de leur homogénéité, fiabilité, etc.)",French
des données utilisées pour l’entrainement mais surtout de leur quantité.,French
"Donc, pour un jeu de données sociales collecté sans attention particulière à la représentation des minorités, l’AA est statistiquement injuste vis-à-vis de celles-ci.",French
"En effet, la capacité à prendre de « bonnes » décisions dépend de la taille des données, or celle-ci sera proportionnellement inférieure pour les minorités.",French
"L’AA ne distingue actuellement pas cause et corrélation de par sa construction mathématique, et est incapable d’aller au-delà du cadre imposé par ses données, il n’a donc pas de capacité d’extrapolation.",French
"Un exemple : si on apprend à un algorithme de retourner le chiffre qu’on lui donne (application identité) en l’entraînant uniquement avec les nombres 1 à 5, il sera incapable de correctement répondre à 6.",French
Il est donc incapable d’extrapoler.,French
L’utilisation d’algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique demande donc d’avoir conscience du cadre de données que l’on a utilisé pour l’apprentissage lors de leur utilisation.,French
Il est donc prétentieux d’attribuer des vertus trop grandes aux algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique[27].,French
"La voiture autonome paraît réalisable grâce à l’apprentissage automatique et les énormes quantités de données générées par la flotte automobile, de plus en plus connectée.",French
"Contrairement aux algorithmes classiques (qui suivent un ensemble de règles prédéterminées), l’apprentissage automatique apprend ses propres règles[28].",French
Les principaux innovateurs dans le domaine insistent sur le fait que le progrès provient de l’automatisation des processus.,French
Ceci présente le défaut que le processus d’apprentissage automatique devient privatisé et obscur.,French
"Privatisé, car les algorithmes d’AA constituent des gigantesques opportunités économiques, et obscurs car leur compréhension passe derrière leur optimisation.",French
"Cette évolution peut potentiellement nuire à la confiance du public envers l’apprentissage automatique, mais surtout au potentiel à long terme de techniques très prometteuses[29].",French
La voiture autonome présente un cadre test pour confronter l’apprentissage automatique à la société.,French
"En effet, ce n’est pas seulement l’algorithme qui se forme à la circulation routière et ses règles, mais aussi l’inverse.",French
"Le principe de responsabilité est remis en cause par l’apprentissage automatique, car l’algorithme n’est plus écrit mais apprend et développe une sorte d’intuition numérique.",French
"Les créateurs d’algorithmes ne sont plus en mesure de comprendre les « décisions » prises par leurs algorithmes, ceci par construction mathématique même de l’algorithme d’apprentissage automatique[30].",French
"Dans le cas de l’AA et les voitures autonomes, la question de la responsabilité en cas d’accident se pose.",French
"La société doit apporter une réponse à cette question, avec différentes approches possibles.",French
"Aux États-Unis, il existe la tendance à juger une technologie par la qualité du résultat qu’elle produit, alors qu’en Europe le principe de précaution est appliqué, et on y a plus tendance à juger une nouvelle technologie par rapport aux précédentes, en évaluant les différences par rapport à ce qui est déjà connu.",French
Des processus d’évaluation de risques sont en cours en Europe et aux États-Unis[29].,French
"La question de responsabilité est d’autant plus compliquée que la priorité chez les concepteurs réside en la conception d’un algorithme optimal, et non pas de le comprendre.",French
"L’interprétabilité des algorithmes est nécessaire pour en comprendre les décisions, notamment lorsque ces décisions ont un impact profond sur la vie des individus.",French
"Cette notion d’interprétabilité, c’est-à-dire de la capacité de comprendre pourquoi et comment un algorithme agit, est aussi sujette à interprétation.",French
"La question de l’accessibilité des données est sujette à controverse : dans le cas des voitures autonomes, certains défendent l’accès public aux données, ce qui permettrait un meilleur apprentissage aux algorithmes et ne concentrerait pas cet « or numérique » dans les mains d’une poignée d’individus, de plus d’autres militent pour la privatisation des données au nom du libre marché, sans négliger le fait que des bonnes données constituent un avantage compétitif et donc économique[29],[31].",French
"Dans les années 2000-2010, l'apprentissage automatique est encore une technologie émergente, mais polyvalente, qui est par nature théoriquement capable d'accélérer le rythme de l'automatisation et de l'autoaprentissage lui-même.",French
"Combiné à l'apparition de nouveaux moyens de produire, stocker et faire circuler l'énergie, ainsi qu'à l'informatique ubiquiste, il pourrait bouleverser les technologies et la société (comme l'ont fait la machine à vapeur et l'électricité, puis le pétrole et l'informatique lors des révolutions industrielles précédentes.",French
"L'apprentissage automatique pourrait générer des innovations et des capacités inattendues, mais avec un risque selon certains observateurs de perte de maitrise de la part des humains sur de nombreuses tâches qu'ils ne pourront plus comprendre et qui seront faites en routine par des entités informatiques et robotisées.",French
"Ceci laisse envisager des impacts spécifiques complexes et encore impossibles à évaluer sur l'emploi, le travail et plus largement l'économie et les inégalités.",French
Selon le journal Science fin 2017 : « Les effets sur l'emploi sont plus complexes que la simple question du remplacement et des substitutions soulignées par certains.,French
"Bien que les effets économiques du BA soient relativement limités aujourd'hui et que nous ne soyons pas confrontés à une « fin du travail » imminente comme cela est parfois proclamé, les implications pour l'économie et la main-d'œuvre sont profondes »[32].",French
Il est tentant de s'inspirer des êtres vivants sans les copier naïvement[33] pour concevoir des machines capables d'apprendre.,French
Les notions de percept et de concept comme phénomènes neuronaux physiques ont d'ailleurs été popularisés dans le monde francophone par Jean-Pierre Changeux.,French
"L'apprentissage automatique reste avant tout un sous-domaine de l'informatique, mais il est étroitement lié opérationnellement aux sciences cognitives, aux neurosciences, à la biologie et à la psychologie, et pourrait à la croisée de ces domaines, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, informatique et sciences cognitives, aboutir à des systèmes d'intelligence artificielle ayant une assise plus vaste.",French
"Des enseignements publics ont notamment été dispensés au Collège de France, l'un par Stanislas Dehaene[34] orienté sur l'aspect bayésien des neurosciences, et l'autre par  Yann LeCun[35] sur les aspects théoriques et pratiques de l'apprentissage profond.",French
"Un algorithme peut être biaisé lorsque son résultat dévie par rapport à un résultat neutre, loyal ou équitable.",French
"Dans certains cas, les biais algorithmiques peuvent conduire à des situations de discrimination[36].",French
Les algorithmes d'apprentissage automatique posent des problèmes d'explicabilité globale du système.,French
"Si certains modèles comme la régression linéaire ou la régression logistique ont un nombre de paramètres limité et peuvent être interprétés, d'autres types de modèle comme les réseaux de neurones artificiels n'ont pas d'interprétation évidente[37].",French
".nous recherchons tous des moyens rapides de devenir plus couramment anglais je sais que je comprends ce qui se passe, c'est qu'il n'y a que quelques mots qui entourent notre cerveau et nous devons faire toute cette conversation en utilisant juste génial incroyable cool ou épique alors que diriez-vous de nous apprenez de nouveaux mots anglais intelligents que vous pouvez utiliser dans votre vie quotidienne et améliorez votre vocabulaire en quelques minutes.",French
"donc aujourd'hui, nous allons apprendre 10 nouveaux mots intelligents, leurs significations, les mots racines et les exemples de phrases, alors allons-y, tout le monde c'est et vous regardez.",French
"et dans cette vidéo, je vais vous donner 10 mots intelligents pour un usage quotidien et à la fin de cette vidéo.",French
Je vais également vous donner une astuce intelligente pour donner un numéro de mot intelligent très fluide.,French
"on est submergé inondé signifie noyade ou inondation, mais inondé est souvent utilisé dans le contexte de travail comme i ' Je suis submergé de travail j'ai trop de travail à faire j'ai été submergé de travail cette semaine entière j'ai à peine eu le temps de respirer maintenant regardons la racine de ce mot.",French
"marais est un morceau de zone humide et si quelqu'un marche au mauvais endroit dans un marais, il pourrait facilement se noyer et la forme verbale de marais signifie couler, alors voici comment utiliser ce mot.",French
disons que vous avez beaucoup de devoirs et que vous avez un test à venir et que vos amis viennent vous voir et disent.,French
"hé pourquoi tu ne traînes pas avec nous, tu peux leur dire que je suis tellement désolé mais je suis submergé de travail ou je suis submergé d'autres mots que vous pouvez utiliser à la place de submergé est-ce que j'ai trop faire.",French
"il y a trop de choses dans mon assiette, je me noie au travail.",French
"Je suis submergé d'affectations, le mot intelligent numéro deux est catch-22 maintenant je suis sûr que vous ' J'ai entendu ce mot avant catch-22 signifie une situation impossible dans laquelle vous ne pouvez pas faire une chose à moins d'avoir fait l'autre et vous ne pouvez pas faire l'autre parce que vous n'avez pas fait la première.",French
"Je vous ai confondu alors laissez-moi vous donner quelques exemples, une situation catch-22 est lorsque vous n'obtenez pas un emploi sans avoir d'expérience de travail.",French
mais vous ne pouvez pas acquérir d'expérience jusqu'à ce que vous obteniez un emploi catch-22 a été inventé par Joseph Heller dans son célèbre livre du même nom catch-22 alors qu'il décrivait certaines règles contradictoires applicables aux soldats pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale.,French
Un autre exemple de catch-22 est que vous avez besoin d'un prêt bancaire parce que vous n'en avez pas assez.,French
"mais vous n'obtiendrez pas ce prêt bancaire à moins que vous ne prouviez à la banque que vous avez suffisamment d'argent, alors la prochaine fois que vous serez coincé dans une situation délicate, rappelez-vous.",French
pour utiliser le mot catch-22.,French
et obtenez ces regards admiratifs de vos amis d'autres mots que vous pouvez utiliser à la place de catch-22 sont des mots intelligents paradoxes ou dilemmes.,French
le numéro trois est suave suave suave signifie être sophistiqué pour être poli et cool.,French
"bien élevé, le mot suave a plusieurs origines différentes, mais une origine très intéressante du mot est ce qui signifie un exemple de dégustation agréable ou sucré.",French
"il est tellement posé et suave surtout devant les dames ou Barack Obama est tellement suave et poli maintenant, souvenez-vous quand vous êtes à une fête la prochaine fois et que vous voyez cette personne qui l'est.",French
bien élevé et cultivé et sophistiqué.,French
n'oubliez pas de dire hé qui est ce gars suave juste là-bas dans le coin en utilisant ce mot fera instantanément votre vocabulaire.,French
très suave si intelligent le mot numéro quatre est atroce atroce le mot atroce signifie quelque chose de vraiment mauvais horrible terrible cruel horrible offensant atroce a une racine latine appelée .qui signifie peur cruelle ou terrible ou les prisonniers sont traités.,French
d'une manière atroce parfois dans les prisons atroce est également utilisé dans la vie de tous les jours pour parler de certains actes répréhensibles et vous voulez l'exagérer.,French
"par exemple, ses manières à table étaient atroces ou son sens vestimentaire est si atroce ou sa grammaire est atroce.",French
"alors la prochaine fois que vous entendrez parler d'un acte horrible aux nouvelles, n'oubliez pas de le faire.",French
"remarquez et dites que c'est un acte atroce le mot intelligent numéro 5 est prodigieux, prodigieux, prodigieux, signifie étonnant étonnant.",French
"maintenant nous utilisons souvent le mot génial ici ' C'est un autre mot que vous pouvez utiliser à la place de génial stupéfiant par exemple aujourd'hui, j'ai obtenu un score incroyable à mon test, ce qui signifie que j'ai obtenu un score très élevé ou J'ai obtenu une partition presque parfaite, le mot prodigieux a des racines latines classiques du mot qui signifie.",French
"être stupéfait si prodigieux est utilisé pour décrire quelque chose qui est incroyablement bon, par exemple, elle a l'air magnifique dans cette robe ou quelle vue magnifique de ce balcon ou je lis ce livre extraordinaire que je ne peux pas dire que diriez-vous d'aller et dire.",French
"vos amis qui sont cette chaîne formidable pour les étudiants et d'autres mots que vous pouvez utiliser au lieu de prodigieux sont incroyablement fantastiques ou exceptionnellement bons, alors avant de continuer avec les cinq mots équilibrés sur cette vidéo, n'oubliez pas de mettre un commentaire sous cette vidéo.",French
me dire lequel de ces dix mots était votre mot intelligent préféré numéro six est dans un correctif dans un correctif signifie être dans une situation gênante par exemple garçon je suis dans une difficulté parce que j'ai fait des plans avec deux amis différents pour cela soir.,French
"J'ai perdu mon téléphone et je suis dans une difficulté ou notre bus est tombé en panne ce matin et je suis dans une situation difficile, mon ami se tourne toujours vers moi pour obtenir de l'aide quand il est dans une situation difficile et quand les choses vont bien, il oublie.",French
"moi donc la prochaine fois que vous aurez des devoirs de mathématiques à l'école par exemple et si vous avez laissé votre livre de mathématiques à l'école, vous pourrez dire à vos amis que vous êtes dans une vraie difficulté maintenant vous pensez peut-être que le mot correctif a quelque chose à faire avec la réparation de quelque chose.",French
mais non dans un correctif signifie être dans une situation gênante d'autres mots que vous pouvez utiliser à la place d'un correctif sont je suis dans une soupe ou je ' Je suis dans un désordre ou je suis dans un endroit ennuyeux ou juste je suis dans un endroit.,French
Le mot intelligent numéro 7 est flummox flummox signifie confondre quelqu'un.,French
"tellement qu'ils oublient quoi faire maintenant confus a tendance à être un mot surutilisé alors au lieu de cela, pourquoi n'utilisez-vous pas flummox, par exemple, le garçon avait l'air complètement décontenancé quand le professeur lui a posé une question en classe ou que le chien était décontenancé à son propre reflet dans le miroir ou le touriste a été étonné par les différentes coutumes qui.",French
"il a rencontré au cours de ses voyages ou lors d'une interview quand on lui a demandé pourquoi devrions-nous vous embaucher, elle avait l'air complètement déconcertée donc la prochaine fois si vous êtes confus sur des questions par exemple lors d'un examen, vous.",French
je peux toujours dire ça parce que je n'avais pas t très bien préparé pour l'examen j'ai été décontenancé par certaines des questions d'autres mots que vous pouvez utiliser au lieu de déconcertés sont déconcertés perplexes ou perplexes Le mot intelligent numéro huit est le rendez-vous rendez-vous rendez-vous.,French
est une façon très française de dire réunion ou date par exemple j'ai rendez-vous avec mes amis pendant le déjeuner le samedi ou je prévois de rendez-vous avec mes amis au centre commercial pour les films rendez-vous peut être utilisé à la fois comme nom ou comme verbe par exemple.,French
j'ai rendez-vous avec mes amis ce soir ou je vais rendez-vous avec mes amis demain.,French
"en france, auparavant, le rendez-vous était utilisé par l'armée pour indiquer un lieu de rencontre pour les troupes.",French
"Maintenant, il y a quelque chose de légèrement excitant et secret dans le mot rendez-vous, même maintenant, alors que vous pouvez utiliser rendez-vous pour n'importe quelle réunion.",French
"en général mais ça a gagné ' t être très approprié pour une réunion officielle, donc si vous avez un rendez-vous peut-être que vous pouvez certainement appeler qu'un rendez-vous le mot intelligent numéro 9 est obtus obtus obtus est une insulte que vous utiliseriez lorsque vous essayez d'appeler quelqu'un de stupide ou d'incompréhensible.",French
ou faible d'esprit maintenant vous avez entendu le mot obtus en géométrie angle obtus et angle aigu donc un angle obtus est un angle supérieur à 90 degrés mais inférieur à 180 degrés.,French
"et un angle aigu est cet angle aigu de moins de 90 degrés si aigu qu'un mot est utilisé pour désigner pointu et donc aussi pointu mentalement et obtus est dénotant émoussé et donc aussi un peu lent dans l'esprit, donc des phrases d'exemple avec obtus sont l'homme était si obtus qu'il a donné son mot de passe à un faux appelant ou à l'enfant obtus.",French
n'a pas pu.,French
pour répondre à une seule question du test ou l'homme obtus a eu du mal à comprendre même les instructions de base supposons maintenant que dans votre situation de vie quotidienne votre petit ami ou votre petite amie est en colère contre vous et vous ne savez pas pourquoi alors vous pouvez.,French
"dites-leur que je suis peut-être obtus, mais je ne sais pas pourquoi vous êtes si bouleversé.",French
"Le mot intelligent numéro 10 est lent, lent, lent, signifie se déplacer lentement pour être un peu plus lent.",French
que d'habitude pour avoir l'air un peu fatigué et manquant.,French
dans l'exemple énergétique un déjeuner lourd me rend très lent l'après-midi a des racines du mot qui signifie une personne lente et une limace est un animal qui se déplace vraiment très lentement comme un exemple d'escargot.,French
l'économie a été très atone cette année ou le match a repris après un début lent.,French
"ou les affaires ont été lentes ce trimestre, vous pouvez l'utiliser dans votre vie quotidienne si vous vous sentez très fatigué un jour, vous pouvez le dire à votre mère ou vous pouvez le dire.",French
"vos amis, je me sens très lent.",French
"aujourd'hui, je pourrais faire avec une boisson énergisante d'autres mots que vous pouvez utiliser à la place de paresseux pourraient être léthargiques ou me traîner les pieds, donc c'étaient les 10 mots intelligents et avant.",French
Je vous donne cette astuce secrète pour avoir l'air très fluide.,French
"Je veux vous rappeler que dans le cas où vous cherchez des mots intelligents à utiliser lors d'un appel téléphonique, je mets un lien vers une vidéo.",French
"dans la zone de description pour cela et maintenant le conseil secret, le conseil secret pour avoir un son fluide est de ne pas utiliser plus d'un mot ou d'une phrase intelligente que je connais parfois.",French
nous sommes très excités parce que.,French
nous' J'ai appris beaucoup de ces mots intelligents et nous avons tendance à en mettre deux trois quatre dans une phrase qui ne semble pas naturelle.,French
"Donc, un à la fois, assurez-vous que vous prononcez le mot de la bonne manière, allez sur Google et tapez le mot et dans la recherche juste en haut, vous verrez une petite icône de haut-parleur cliquer sur ce haut-parleur.",French
et écoutez la prononciation une ou deux fois.,French

Nature (Engels voor 'natuur') is een Brits vooral natuurwetenschappelijk tijdschrift.,Dutch
Het staat als gerenommeerd bekend.,Dutch
Het verscheen voor het eerst op 4 november 1869[1] en werd opgericht door de amateur-astronoom Norman Lockyer.,Dutch
Het groeide uit van een eenvoudige publicatie voor amateur-wetenschappers tot een van de meest gerenommeerde wetenschappelijke tijdschriften.,Dutch
Een publicatie in Nature wordt door wetenschappers zeer hoog aangeslagen.,Dutch
"Er zijn geen tijdschriften met een hogere impactfactor, behalve misschien Science, dat met Nature om de toppositie concurreert.",Dutch
De impactfactor van Nature schommelt rond de 40.[bron?],Dutch
"Hoewel Nature een lichte nadruk op biologie legt, accepteert het artikelen uit allerlei wetenschappelijke vakgebieden.",Dutch
"Er zijn inmiddels diverse speciale edities die zich met aparte vakgebieden bezighouden: Verder bestaan er nog enkele edities van Nature Reviews, waarin hoogkwalitatieve overzichtsartikelen verschijnen.",Dutch

"Op Wikipedia gelden vijf principes, zuilen genoemd:[2] Naast deze drie zuilen gelden twee interne zuilen: De naam Wikipedia is een samentrekking van wiki, dat in het Hawaiiaans snel betekent, en het Engelse woord encyclopedia.",Dutch
"Wikipedia was de eerste serieuze, algemene, digitale encyclopedie waarbij met het wiki-concept gewerkt werd.",Dutch
"In vergelijking met andere concepten om informatie te verzamelen heeft dit tot gevolg dat Wikipedia, daar waar het actuele informatie betreft, in het algemeen snel bijgewerkt is.",Dutch
Daar verwijst het eerder genoemde woord wiki ook naar.,Dutch

Voor lexicografische informatie is het zusterproject Wiktionary (in het Nederlands WikiWoordenboek) in het leven geroepen.,Dutch
Voor mobiele apparaten zijn ook speciale apps beschikbaar.,Dutch
Over de documentering van de menselijke kennis wordt al vele jaren nagedacht.,Dutch
"Onder andere de bibliograaf Paul Otlet, bedenker van de Universele Decimale Classificatie (UDC), wijdde zijn leven aan de vraag hoe gegevens en kennis toegankelijk gemaakt kunnen worden in een Universeel Boek of een vernuftig kaartsysteem met behulp van een machinaal systeem.",Dutch
"[3] Later streefde Herbert George Wells naar een World Brain,[4] een samenvatting van alle kennis op microfilm.",Dutch
Ook Vannevar Bush dacht dat de toekomst van volledige documentatie lag in een systeem met microfilm: Memex.,Dutch
[5] In 1960 begon Ted Nelson met zijn Project Xanadu dat gebruikmaakte van hypertekst.,Dutch
De Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia van Philips' CDI (1992) en Encarta (1993) van Microsoft waren de eerste encyclopedieën op cd-rom die gebruikmaakten van hyperlinks.,Dutch
"Wikipedia is een modern antwoord en maakt gebruik van de nieuwe mogelijkheden van www, internet en software voor samenwerking.",Dutch
"Wikipedia werd in 2001 opgericht door de Amerikaanse ondernemer Jimmy Wales, samen met zijn medewerker Larry Sanger.",Dutch
"In 2003 droeg Wales zijn rechten op de naam Wikipedia, de website zelf en de servers waarop deze draaide over aan de Wikimedia Foundation, een stichting die hij oprichtte om het behoud en de verdere ontwikkeling van Wikipedia langdurig mogelijk te maken.",Dutch
De stichting leeft bijna uitsluitend van donaties en had anno 2017 in de Verenigde Staten ongeveer 280 betaalde medewerkers.,Dutch
Wikipedia zelf wordt echter door vrijwilligers beheerd en geschreven.,Dutch
"Het project Wikipedia begon met een conversatie tussen twee internetvrienden, Larry Sanger, hoofdredacteur van Nupedia en Ben Kovitz, een computerprogrammeur en bèta-wetenschapper, op de avond van 3 januari 2001 in San Diego (Californië).",Dutch
Kovitz had al eerder te maken gehad met een ander soort wikiproject.,Dutch
"Toen hij het basisconcept aan Sanger uitlegde, zag deze onmiddellijk dat het wikiformat geschikt zou zijn voor het opzetten van een opener, minder formeel project dan Nupedia.",Dutch
"Vier maanden daarvoor hadden Sanger en zijn baas Jimmy Wales, president-directeur van Bomis, Inc., al eens verschillende mogelijkheden besproken om naast Nupedia een opener, aanvullend project te beginnen.",Dutch
Het kostte Sanger dus niet veel moeite om Wales over te halen een wiki voor Nupedia op te zetten.,Dutch
Nupedia's eerste wiki ging online op 10 januari 2001.,Dutch
"Van de kant van de auteurs en redacteuren van Nupedia kwam echter het nodige protest tegen het plan om Nupedia zo nauw te associëren met een webpagina, gebaseerd op het wikiconcept.",Dutch
"Daarom kreeg het nieuwe project per 15 januari de naam 'Wikipedia' en een eigen, onafhankelijk adres op het web.",Dutch
Deze datum werd later uitgeroepen tot Wikipediadag.,Dutch
Nieuwe deelnemers meldden zich aan via een publicatie van Slashdot in maart en juli.,Dutch
"Ook andere publicaties trokken deelnemers, zoals die op Kuro5hin.",Dutch
Zoekmachines (vooral Google) en andere portals dirigeerden dagelijks honderden potentiële deelnemers naar Wikipedia.[bron?],Dutch
Op 12 februari 2001 werd in de Engelstalige Wikipedia de eerste mijlpaal van 1000 artikelen (pagina's) overschreden; daarna groeide het aantal artikelen met circa 1000 per maand en inmiddels (2020) met ongeveer 150.000 per maand[6].,Dutch
Op 19 juni 2001 ging de Nederlandstalige versie van Wikipedia van start.,Dutch
"De oorspronkelijke en verreweg de grootste van alle Wikipedia's is de Engelstalige versie, die van start ging op 15 januari 2001.",Dutch
Het oorspronkelijke doel was te komen tot een minimum van 100.000 artikelen.,Dutch
"Toen dat aantal eenmaal was bereikt, ging de groei echter nog volop door.",Dutch
Vanaf de zomer van 2001 zijn er naast de oorspronkelijke Engelstalige versie steeds meer Wikipedia's in andere talen gestart.,Dutch
"Na de Engelstalige waren in 2015, gemeten naar het aantal individuele artikelen, de Duits-, Frans-, Nederlands- en Zweedstalige Wikipedia's het grootst.",Dutch
"Opgemerkt moet worden dat dit niets zegt over de grootte, de (gemiddelde) kwaliteit of de diversiteit van de artikelen.",Dutch
In totaal waren er in februari 2015 meer dan 34 miljoen artikelen te vinden in 288 verschillende talen.,Dutch
"Er zijn ook enkele Wikipedia's opgestart in minderheidstalen, dialecten en inmiddels uitgestorven talen (zoals het Latijn en Oudengels).",Dutch
Zo bevatte de Wikipedia in het Zazaki begin 2010 ongeveer 2800 artikelen.,Dutch
"Er zijn eveneens versies begonnen in enkele bekende kunsttalen, zoals het Esperanto en het Klingon.",Dutch
[7] Een aantal van deze Wikipedia's bleek echter over onvoldoende vaste bijdragers te beschikken om de projecten draaiende te houden.,Dutch
Deze weinig levensvatbare projecten zijn inmiddels weer gesloten en/of in de Wikimedia Incubator beland.,Dutch
De meeste opslagcapaciteit is nodig voor de afbeeldingen en andere media die op Wikipedia gebruikt worden.,Dutch
Op 15 januari 2009 meldde Wikizine dat er 48 terabyte opslagruimte beschikbaar was gekomen voor Wikimedia Commons.,Dutch
Op dat moment werd daar 5 terabyte van gebruikt.,Dutch
[8] In de maanden augustus en september 2003 werd een internationale logowedstrijd gehouden.,Dutch
Het logo van Paul Stansifer werd met grote meerderheid verkozen.,Dutch
Daarna werd dit aangepast tot een grijze versie op basis van hetzelfde idee.,Dutch
"Vanaf 2005 begonnen de bewerkers (users, in het Nederlands vaak ""gebruikers"" genoemd) op Wikipedia steeds meer samen te werken met culturele instellingen en andere organisaties om meer materiaal beschikbaar te krijgen voor het gebruik op Wikipedia.",Dutch
"Er wordt samengewerkt met onder andere musea, galeries, archieven en bibliotheken om zo meer specialistische informatie en vooral ook beeldmateriaal om meer artikelen hiervan te kunnen voorzien.",Dutch
"In Nederland leverde bijvoorbeeld het Tropenmuseum meer dan 8.000 afbeeldingen over de Marrons, Suriname en Indonesië,[9][10] het Nationaal Archief in Den Haag en Spaarnestad Photo te Haarlem doneren ruim 1100 foto's van Nederlandse politici en belangrijke gebeurtenissen in Nederland[11] en het Amsterdam Museum doneerde in 2011 zijn digitale collectie van 55.000 foto's.",Dutch
[12] De Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed (RCE) heeft in september 2012 van de 555.000 afbeeldingen van haar collectie er 465.000 vrijgegeven met een maximale pixelgrootte van 1200 pixels onder de cc-by-sa-3.0-nl licentie.,Dutch
Sinds 2010 wordt de samenwerking tussen Wikipedia en culturele instellingen verder geïntensiveerd met de aanstelling van een 'Wikipedian in Residence' bij de instellingen zelf om hun materiaal via Wikipedia te ontsluiten.,Dutch
"[13] Op 15 januari 2016, de 15e verjaardag van Wikipedia, werd bekend dat er een fonds was opgericht, de Wikimedia Endowment, dat de komende 10 jaar 100 miljoen dollar moet gaan inzamelen teneinde het voortbestaan van Wikipedia op de lange termijn te garanderen.",Dutch
[14] In mei 2004 ontving Wikipedia de Golden Nica voor digitale gemeenschappen van de jaarlijkse Prix Ars Electronica-wedstrijd.,Dutch
"Later dat jaar ontving Wikipedia de Judges' Webby Award in de categorie ""community"".",Dutch
"[15] Wikipedia werd ook genomineerd voor de ""Best Practices"" prijs.",Dutch
"In 2007 stemden de lezers van de website brandchannel.com voor Wikipedia als 4de in de lijst van merken, via het antwoord op de vraag ""Welk merk had de grootste invloed op onze levens in 2006?""",Dutch
"In september 2008 ontving Wikipedia de ""Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment"" van Werkstatt Deutschland samen met Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling en Peter Gabriel.",Dutch
Deze prijs werd aangeboden aan Jimbo Wales door David Weinberger.,Dutch
"[16] Op 15 januari 2015 kreeg de Wikipediagemeenschap de Erasmusprijs toegekend, ""omdat zij de verspreiding van kennis heeft bevorderd door een allesomvattende, voor ieder toegankelijke encyclopedie op te zetten"".",Dutch
[17][18] Volgens de organisatie van de prijs droeg Wikipedia door haar open karakter bij aan het besef dat bronnen van kennis niet neutraal zijn en steeds gewogen moeten worden.,Dutch
Met deze kritische aandacht sloot Wikipedia goed aan bij het gedachtegoed van Erasmus.,Dutch
Op 25 november 2015 reikte koning Willem-Alexander deze prijs uit aan drie vertegenwoordigers van de gemeenschap.,Dutch
[19] Op 17 juni 2015 werd de jaarlijkse Prinses van Asturiëprijs voor internationale samenwerking toegekend aan Wikipedia.,Dutch
[20] Wikipedia heeft net als andere wiki's te kampen met vandalisme.,Dutch
Hiervoor zijn hulpmiddelen beschikbaar om vandalisme te bestrijden en bijvoorbeeld misbruik van sokpopaccounts op te sporen.,Dutch
'Onzichtbaar vandalisme' en hoaxen blijken echter hardnekkiger te zijn.,Dutch
Door subtiele wijzigingen (beperkte weglatingen of wijziging van de opmaak) kan een heel andere wending aan een artikel worden gegeven.,Dutch
Ook kan iemand per ongeluk foutieve informatie toevoegen.,Dutch
"Wanneer niemand doorheeft dat de informatie onjuist is, kan die maandenlang op Wikipedia blijven staan.",Dutch
"Zo zijn er gevallen bekend van artikelen over niet-bestaande personen, waar wel maandenlang een artikel over bestond.",Dutch
Artikelen op Wikipedia scoren over het algemeen hoog in de zoekmachines.,Dutch
Dit heeft als neveneffect dat ook eventuele foutieve informatie zich vanaf Wikipedia snel over het internet kan verspreiden.,Dutch
Wikipedia wordt bewerkt door vrijwilligers en heeft een open structuur.,Dutch
In principe kan iedereen daardoor meewerken aan de encyclopedie.,Dutch
In de praktijk blijkt er echter geen sprake van een volledige afspiegeling van de maatschappij.,Dutch
Zo komt uit onderzoek van de Wikimedia Foundation naar enkele kenmerken van bewerkers van Wikipedia naar voren dat de meerderheid van de bewerkers mannelijk is en geen partner en kinderen heeft.,Dutch
"Ongeveer de helft valt in de leeftijd tussen 18 en 30 jaar oud, terwijl de groep jonger dan 18 zo'n 25% bedraagt.",Dutch
"Het dominante profiel van de bewerkers heeft - algemeen gesproken - gevolgen voor het soort en aantal artikelen en daarnaast ook voor de inhoud van artikelen, wat Dale Hoiberg, voormalig hoofdredacteur van de Encyclopædia Britannica, een systematische fout of bias noemt.",Dutch
"In vergelijking met traditionele encyclopedieën is er dan ook meer aandacht voor sporters, informatica en popcultuur, terwijl onderwerpen als natuurwetenschap, taal, kunst en Afrika soms ondervertegenwoordigd zijn.",Dutch
Zo was bijvoorbeeld het artikel over de stripfiguren Casper en Hobbes op de Engelstalige Wikipedia een tijdlang uitgebreider dan dat over William Shakespeare.,Dutch
The Guardian gaf in 2014 aan dat een artikel op de Engelstalige Wikipedia met een lijst van porno-actrices meer voetnoten kende dan dat met een lijst van schrijfsters.,Dutch
"[21] Dit werd al vroeg onderkend, zoals bleek uit projecten als CROSSBOW en het wikiproject systematische bias, die echter niet van lange duur waren.",Dutch
Naast de kenmerken in het onderzoek van de Wikimedia Foundation spelen ook andere kenmerken een rol.,Dutch
"Zo verschilt de demografie per Wikipedia sterk, wat zijn invloed heeft op het soort artikelen en de inhoud daarvan.",Dutch
"Artikelen over bepaalde landen, volken, gebruiken en religies zullen niet op elke Wikipedia dezelfde aandacht krijgen.",Dutch
Andere initiatieven zijn onder meer het wegwerken van overmatige nadruk in artikelen op specifieke landen.,Dutch
[noot 1] De bewerkers van Wikipedia zijn merendeels mannelijk.,Dutch
"Daarom schreef de New Statesman dat de Engelstalige versie niet de ""sum of all knowledge"" was - de visie van Jimmy Wales, een van de oprichters van Wikipedia - maar eerder de ""sum of male knowledge"".",Dutch
[22] In het tijdschrift Slate noemde Heather Mac Donald dit in 2011 echter geen probleem: De eenvoudigste verklaring voor het verschil in deelname (...) is dat mannen en vrouwen gemiddeld andere interesses hebben en hun vrije tijd op een andere manier willen besteden.,Dutch
"[23] In 2011 bleek uit onderzoek dat de Engelstalige Wikipedia weliswaar meer artikelen over vrouwen had dan de Encyclopaedia Britannica, maar ook dat de kans dat een artikel over een vrouw ontbrak groter was dan over een man.",Dutch
Dat effect was bovendien sterker in de Wikipedia dan in de Britannica.,Dutch
[24] Uit onderzoek uit 2015 bleek dat de biografieën van vrouwen heel anders geschreven waren dan die van mannen.,Dutch
[25] Het gebrek aan artikelen over vrouwen werd belangrijk genoeg gevonden om met verschillende nieuwe projecten weg te werken.,Dutch
"Op de presentatie van artikelen in de userinterface van Wikipedia wordt wel kritiek geuit, omdat deze niet modern, rommelig en niet gebruiksvriendelijk zou zijn.",Dutch
"Een modernere presentatie van deze artikelen wordt bijvoorbeeld geboden door Wikiwand, een gepatenteerde software-interface die hiervoor is ontwikkeld.",Dutch
Wikiwand is zelf geen onderdeel van MediaWiki.,Dutch
In Het Financieele Dagblad verscheen in 2016 een artikel waarin werd gesteld dat Wikipedia negatief bijdraagt aan de economische groei.,Dutch
[noot 2][26] Wikipedia werd al eerder gezien als een oneerlijke concurrent voor traditionele encyclopedieën.,Dutch
"Nicholas Carr viel in The amorality of Web 2.0 (2005, Web 2.0 is amoreel) websites met gebruikersbijdragen als Wikipedia aan, omdat ze beroepsschrijvers (die volgens hem superieur zijn) het brood uit de mond kunnen stoten, want ""gratis wint altijd van kwaliteit"".",Dutch
"Carr schreef: ""De geestdriftige visioenen van Web 2.0 gaan er stilzwijgend van uit dat de amateur de overhand krijgt.",Dutch
"Maar ik kan me niets angstaanjagenders voorstellen"".",Dutch
[27] Anderen bestrijden dat Wikipedia of iets dergelijks de traditionele publicaties volledig gaat verdringen.,Dutch
"Chris Anderson, hoofdredacteur van Wired Magazine, beweerde in het natuurwetenschappelijke tijdschrift Nature dat Wikipedia met haar gebruik van groepsverstand (wisdom of crowds) de wetenschappelijke toptijdschriften niet zal vervangen, vanwege de andere rol en strenge procedures voor collegiale toetsing van die tijdschriften.",Dutch
[28] Wikipedia zou censuur willen vermijden.,Dutch
Zo werd in 2006 op de Duitstalige Wikipedia geweigerd om de naam van een overleden hacker te verwijderen toen de familie daarom vroeg.,Dutch
"[29] Ook werd in 2008 een platenhoes niet verwijderd nadat een Britse organisatie die hoes als kinderpornografie had bestempeld, waardoor in grote delen van het Verenigd Koninkrijk Wikipedia niet meer bereikbaar was.",Dutch
[30] Turkije blokkeerde van 29 april 2017 tot 16 januari 2020[31] de toegang tot alle talenversies van Wikipedia nadat de encyclopedie had geweigerd sommige inhoud te verwijderen.,Dutch
"[32][33] Niettemin werd in 2009 wel informatie verwijderd over de ontvoering van David S. Rohde door de taliban, omdat volgens de New York Times zijn leven in gevaar kon komen door het bekendmaken van de ontvoering.",Dutch
"[34] T. Bayer gaf in 2012 een overzicht van verschillende onderzoeken, die uitwezen dat de Engelse en Duitse Wikipedia gemiddeld betrouwbaar waren.",Dutch
"[35] Een vergelijking in september 2004 van de Duitstalige Wikipedia en twee andere Duitstalige encyclopedieën, Brockhaus en Encarta, door het computertijdschrift c't, viel in het voordeel van Wikipedia uit.",Dutch
In 2005 publiceerde Nature de resultaten van een vergelijkend onderzoek naar de kwaliteit van artikelen in de Engelse Wikipedia (WP) en de Encyclopædia Britannica (EB).,Dutch
"[36] Universitaire deskundigen bogen zich over natuurwetenschappelijke teksten, zonder te weten uit welke encyclopedie ze kwamen.",Dutch
In 42 paren van overeenkomstige artikelen uit beide encyclopedieën vonden ze zowel in WP als in EB totaal acht ernstige fouten.,Dutch
"Gemiddeld bevatte een WP-artikel vier en een EB-artikel drie foutjes, weglatingen of misleidende beweringen.",Dutch
"Nature concludeerde dat hoewel de schrijfstijl van de Britannica veel beter was, de Wikipedia op natuurwetenschappelijk gebied bijna net zo goed was als de Britannica.",Dutch
Orlowski formuleerde het als volgt: de kwaliteit van informatie in deze artikelen was in Wikipedia daarmee 31 procent minder dan in de Britannica.,Dutch
[37] Het betrof hier een betrekkelijk kleine selectie van artikelen over exacte wetenschappen en techniek en veel van de aangetroffen 'fouten' betroffen meningsverschillen tussen de onderzoekers van Nature en de redacteuren van de Britannica over welke feiten vermeld zouden moeten worden in een encyclopedie.,Dutch
"[38] In maart 2006 publiceerde de Encyclopædia Britannica onder de titel ""Fatally Flawed"" een weerlegging van de onderzoeksresultaten van Nature.",Dutch
[39] Er bestaan op het internet een aantal klonen – ook wel mirrors of spiegelsites genoemd – van Wikipedia.,Dutch
Dit zijn websites die de inhoud van Wikipedia-artikelen of een deel hiervan (vrijwel) letterlijk overnemen.,Dutch
"Enkele voorbeelden zijn DBpedia, EverybodyWiki Bios & Wiki, Wikiwand en (specifiek in het Nederlands) Encyclo.nl.",Dutch
Ook sommige teksten op WordPress.com zijn min of meer letterlijk afkomstig van Wikipedia.,Dutch
"Daarnaast wordt veel van de vrij beschikbare inhoud van Wikipedia door allerlei individuele sites overgenomen en hergebruikt, al dan niet in de vorm van letterlijk gekopieerde tekstpassages.",Dutch
"Regelmatig laten deze sites na om de bron van deze informatie correct weer te geven, waardoor de vereiste auteursrechtelijke kennisgevingen niet gerealiseerd worden.",Dutch
"Een belangrijk neveneffect van dergelijke ""kloonwebsites"" en andere sites die zich primair op Wikipedia baseren is dat ze ervoor zorgen dat informatie op het internet steeds eenzijdiger wordt.",Dutch
"Het is geen zeldzaamheid dat vijf van de eerste tien zoekresultaten op Google allemaal hetzelfde artikel bevatten, op verschillende sites.",Dutch
Foutieve informatie kan op deze manier snel over het internet worden verspreid.,Dutch
Critici van Wikipedia zien dit als een zorgelijke ontwikkeling.,Dutch
"Automatisch leren of machinaal leren is een breed onderzoeksveld binnen kunstmatige intelligentie, dat zich bezighoudt met de ontwikkeling van algoritmes en technieken waarmee computers kunnen leren.",Dutch
De methodes zijn te verdelen in twee ruwe categorieën: aanleidinggevend en deductief.,Dutch
Aanleidinggevende methodes creëren computerprogramma's door het vormen van regels of het extraheren van patronen uit data.,Dutch
Deductieve methoden hebben als resultaat een functie die net zo generiek is als de invoerdata.,Dutch
"Automatisch leren is sterk gerelateerd aan statistiek, aangezien beide velden de studie van data analyseren.",Dutch
Automatisch leren is meer gericht op de algoritmische complexiteit of de implementatie in programma's.,Dutch
"Het is ook gerelateerd aan datamining, waarin op een geautomatiseerde manier patronen en relaties worden gezocht in grote hoeveelheden gegevens.",Dutch
"Veel leerproblemen zijn NP-hard of moeilijker, dus een belangrijk onderdeel van dit vakgebied is algoritmes te ontwikkelen die de oplossing benaderen.",Dutch
"Methodes voor machinaal leren zijn onderverdeeld in een typologie: 
.we zijn allemaal op zoek naar snelle manieren om vloeiend Engels te spreken ik weet dat ik begrijp wat er gebeurt, is dat er maar een paar woorden rond onze hersenen cirkelen en dat we dit hele gesprek moeten voeren met gewoon geweldig geweldig cool of episch dus hoe zit het met wij leer enkele slimme nieuwe Engelse woorden die u in uw dagelijks leven kunt gebruiken en verbeter uw vocabulaire in enkele minuten.",Dutch
"dus vandaag gaan we 10 nieuwe slimme woorden leren, hun betekenis, wortelwoorden en voorbeeldzinnen, dus laten we aan de slag gaan, hey dit is allemaal en jullie kijken.",Dutch
en in deze video ga ik je 10 slimme woorden geven voor dagelijks gebruik en aan het einde van deze video.,Dutch
Ik ga je ook een slimme tip geven om heel vloeiend slim woordnummer te laten klinken.,Dutch
"één is overspoeld overspoeld betekent verdrinken of overstromen, maar overspoeld wordt vaak gebruikt in de context van werk zoals ik ' m overspoeld met werk ik heb te veel werk te doen ik ben de hele week overspoeld met werk ik heb amper tijd gehad om te ademen, laten we nu eens kijken naar de wortel van dit woord.",Dutch
"moeras is een stuk wetland en als iemand op de verkeerde plaats in een moeras stapt, kunnen ze gemakkelijk verdrinken en de werkwoordsvorm moeras betekent zinken, dus hier is hoe je dit woord kunt gebruiken.",Dutch
laten we zeggen dat je veel opdrachten hebt en er komt een toets aan en je vrienden komen naar je toe en zeggen.,Dutch
"hey waarom ga je niet met ons om, je kunt tegen ze zeggen dat het me zo spijt, maar ik word overspoeld door werk of ik word overspoeld met andere woorden die je kunt gebruiken in plaats van overspoeld, heb ik te veel Te doen.",Dutch
er ligt teveel op mijn bord.,Dutch
Ik verdrink in mijn werk.,Dutch
ik word overspoeld met opdrachten slim woord nummer twee is catch-22 nu weet ik zeker dat je ' Ik heb dit woord al gehoord voordat catch-22 een onmogelijke situatie betekent waarin je het ene niet kunt doen tenzij je het andere hebt gedaan en je het andere niet kunt doen omdat je de eerste niet hebt gedaan.,Dutch
"Ik heb je in de war gebracht, dus laat me je wat voorbeelden geven.",Dutch
Een catch-22-situatie is wanneer je geen baan krijgt zonder werkervaring te hebben.,Dutch
maar je kunt pas ervaring opdoen als je een baan krijgt.,Dutch
catch-22 werd bedacht door Joseph Heller in zijn beroemde boek met dezelfde naam catch-22 toen hij enkele tegenstrijdige regels beschreef die van toepassing waren op soldaten tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog.,Dutch
een ander voorbeeld van catch-22 is dat je een banklening nodig hebt omdat je er niet genoeg van hebt.,Dutch
"geld, maar je zou die banklening niet krijgen tenzij je aan de bank bewijst dat je genoeg geld hebt, dus onthoud de volgende keer dat je vastzit in een lastige situatie.",Dutch
om het woord catch-22 te gebruiken.,Dutch
en krijg deze bewonderende blikken van je vrienden andere woorden die je kunt gebruiken in plaats van catch-22 zijn paradox of dilemma slim woord.,Dutch
nummer drie is suave suave suave middelen om verfijnd te zijn om beleefd evenwichtig cool en.,Dutch
"welgemanierd heeft het woord suave verschillende oorsprong, maar een zeer interessante oorsprong van het woord is wat aangenaam of zoet smakend voorbeeld betekent.",Dutch
"hij is zo evenwichtig en zacht, vooral in het bijzijn van de dames of barack.",Dutch
Obama is zo zacht en gepolijst nu onthoud wanneer je de volgende keer op een feest bent en je deze persoon ziet die zo is.,Dutch
welgemanierd en gecultiveerd en verfijnd.,Dutch
"vergeet niet te zeggen: wie is die vriendelijke kerel die daar in de hoek is, met dit woord zal je woordenschat meteen toenemen.",Dutch
heel zacht zo slim woord nummer vier is afschuwelijk afschuwelijk het woord afschuwelijk betekent iets heel ergs afschuwelijk verschrikkelijk afschuwelijk aanstootgevend afschuwelijk heeft een Latijnse wortel genaamd.,Dutch
wat betekent angst wreed of verschrikkelijk enkele voorbeelden van het woord afschuwelijk zijn de recente verkrachtingsincidenten in Delhi waren afschuwelijk of gevangenen worden behandeld.,Dutch
op een gruwelijke manier wordt soms in gevangenissen gruwelijk ook in het dagelijks leven gebruikt om over een veelvoorkomend kwaad te praten en dat wil je overdrijven.,Dutch
zijn tafelmanieren waren bijvoorbeeld afschuwelijk of haar gevoel voor kleding is zo afschuwelijk of zijn grammatica is afschuwelijk.,Dutch
dus vergeet niet om de volgende keer dat je op het nieuws over een gruwelijke daad hoort.,Dutch
"opmerken en zeggen dat dit een gruwelijke daad is, slim woord nummer 5 is ontzagwekkend, ontzagwekkend, ontzagwekkend, betekent verbazingwekkend verbazingwekkend.",Dutch
"nu gebruiken we hier vaak het woord geweldig ' s een ander woord dat je kunt gebruiken in plaats van geweldig verbazingwekkend, bijvoorbeeld vandaag heb ik een verbazingwekkende score op mijn test, wat betekent dat ik een zeer hoge score heb gehaald of.",Dutch
ik heb een bijna perfecte score.,Dutch
Het woord verbazingwekkend heeft klassieke Latijnse wortels van het woord dat betekent.,Dutch
"verbluft zijn zo ontzagwekkend wordt gebruikt om iets te beschrijven dat verbluffend goed is, ze ziet er bijvoorbeeld ontzagwekkend uit in die jurk of wat een geweldig uitzicht vanaf dit balkon of ik lees dit ontzagwekkende boek dat ik niet kan neerleggen hoe zit het met jou en vertellen.",Dutch
"je vrienden, dat is dit geweldige kanaal voor studenten en sommige andere woorden die je kunt gebruiken in plaats van verbluffend zijn ongelooflijk fantastisch of uitzonderlijk goed, oké, dus voordat we verder gaan met de uitgebalanceerde vijf woorden op deze video, vergeet dan niet om een ​​opmerking onder deze video te plaatsen.",Dutch
om me te vertellen welk van deze tien woorden je favoriete slimme woord was nummer zes zit in een fix in een fix betekent dat je in een lastige situatie verkeert bijvoorbeeld jongen ik zit in een moeilijke situatie omdat ik hier met twee verschillende vrienden plannen voor heb gemaakt avond.,Dutch
"ik ben mijn telefoon kwijt en ik zit in de problemen of onze bus is vanmorgen kapot gegaan en ik zit in de problemen, mijn vriend wendt zich altijd tot mij voor hulp als hij in de problemen zit en als het goed gaat, vergeet hij het.",Dutch
"dus de volgende keer dat je wiskundehuiswerk van school krijgt, bijvoorbeeld en als je je wiskundeboek op school hebt achtergelaten, kun je je vrienden vertellen dat je in een echte situatie zit, nu denk je misschien dat het woord repareren iets te doen heeft met iets repareren.",Dutch
maar nee in een fix betekent dat je in een lastige situatie zit andere woorden die je kunt gebruiken in plaats van in een fix zit ik in een soep of ik ' ik zit in een puinhoop of ik zit in de problemen of ik ben gewoon op een plek slim woord nummer 7 is flummox flummox betekent iemand verwarren.,Dutch
"zo vaak dat ze vergeten wat ze nu moeten doen verward is meestal een te veel gebruikt woord, dus waarom gebruik je geen flummox bijvoorbeeld, de jongen zag er helemaal uit.",Dutch
stomverbaasd toen de leraar hem een ​​vraag stelde in de klas of de hond keek stomverbaasd bij zijn eigen spiegelbeeld in de spiegel of de toerist was in de war door de verschillende gebruiken die.,Dutch
"die hij tegenkwam tijdens zijn reizen of in een interview toen haar werd gevraagd waarom we je zouden inhuren, zag ze er compleet stomverbaasd uit, dus als je de volgende keer in de war raakt over vragen, bijvoorbeeld tijdens een examen, dan jij.",Dutch
kan dat altijd zeggen omdat ik dat niet had gedaan Ik heb me goed voorbereid op het examen.,Dutch
Ik was stomverbaasd door enkele van de vragen.,Dutch
"Andere woorden die je kunt gebruiken in plaats van verward zijn verbijsterd, verbaasd of verbijsterd.",Dutch
"is een heel Franse manier om ontmoeting of datum te zeggen, ik heb bijvoorbeeld een afspraak met mijn vrienden tijdens de lunch op zaterdag of ik ben van plan om met mijn vrienden af ​​te spreken in het winkelcentrum voor films rendez-vous kan zowel als zelfstandig naamwoord of als werkwoord worden gebruikt bijvoorbeeld.",Dutch
ik heb vanavond een afspraak met mijn vrienden of ik ga morgen met mijn vrienden afspreken.,Dutch
"in Frankrijk werd eerdere afspraak door het leger gebruikt om een ​​ontmoetingsplaats voor de troepen aan te duiden, nu is er iets spannends en geheimzinnigs aan het woord rendez-vous, zelfs nu, terwijl je rendez-vous voor elke bijeenkomst kunt gebruiken.",Dutch
"in het algemeen maar het won ' het is erg geschikt voor een officiële vergadering, dus als je een date hebt, kun je misschien zeker noemen dat een rendez-vous slim woord nummer 9 stomp is stomp stomp is een belediging die je zou gebruiken als je iemand dom of ongewild probeert te noemen of domme nu je het woord stomp hebt gehoord in geometrie stompe hoek en scherpe hoek, dus een stompe hoek is een hoek groter dan 90 graden maar kleiner dan 180 graden.",Dutch
en een scherpe hoek is deze scherpe hoek minder dan 90 graden zo scherp als een woord wordt gebruikt om scherp aan te duiden en daarom ook mentaal scherp en stomp is duidt bot en daarom ook een beetje traag in de geest dus voorbeeldzinnen met stomp zijn de man was zo stom dat hij zijn wachtwoord weggaf aan een nep-beller of het stompe kind.,Dutch
was niet in staat.,Dutch
om een ​​enkele vraag op de test te beantwoorden of de stompe man had het moeilijk om zelfs de basisinstructies te begrijpen.,Dutch

slim woord nummer 10 is traag traag traag betekent om langzaam te bewegen om een ​​beetje langzamer te zijn.,Dutch
dan normaal om er een beetje moe en gebrekkig uit te zien.,Dutch
in energievoorbeeld maakt een zware lunch me erg in de namiddag traag heeft wortels van het woord wat een traag persoon betekent en een naaktslak is een dier dat echt heel langzaam beweegt zoals een slak bijvoorbeeld.,Dutch
de economie was dit jaar erg traag of de wedstrijd werd hervat na een trage start.,Dutch
"of zaken zijn dit kwartaal traag geweest, je kunt het in je dagelijks leven gebruiken als je je op een dag erg moe voelt, dat kan je je moeder vertellen of je kunt het zien.",Dutch
"je vrienden, ik voel me erg traag.",Dutch
"vandaag zou ik kunnen doen met een energiedrank, andere woorden die je kunt gebruiken in plaats van traag, kunnen lusteloos zijn of slepend met mijn voeten, dus dat waren de 10 slimme woorden en eerder.",Dutch
Ik geef je die geheime tip om heel vloeiend te klinken.,Dutch
"Ik wil je eraan herinneren dat als je op zoek bent naar slimme woorden voor een telefoongesprek, ik een link naar een video plaats.",Dutch
daarvoor in het beschrijvingsvak en nu de geheime tip.,Dutch
De geheime tip om vloeiend te klinken is om niet meer dan één slim woord of zin te gebruiken die ik soms ken.,Dutch
we worden erg opgewonden omdat.,Dutch
"wij' Ik heb een heleboel van deze slimme woorden geleerd en we hebben de neiging om er twee, drie, vier in één zin te proppen die niet natuurlijk klinkt.",Dutch
zorg er dus een voor een voor dat je het woord op de juiste manier uitspreekt.,Dutch
"ga naar google en typ het woord en in de zoekopdracht rechtsboven zie je een klein luidsprekerpictogram, klik op die luidspreker.",Dutch
en hoor de uitspraak een of twee keer.,Dutch

"dat is verlicht, wat betekent dat dat verbazingwekkend is, zeiden veel Amerikanen in Californië.",Dutch
"oh dat is verlicht en je hebt het waarschijnlijk gehoord in liedjes die ' Gaat branden als iemand succesvol is na mislukkingen, dus je kunt zeggen dat je gaat ik zei je dat je het gaat redden als iemand je vraagt ​​of je moe bent en je wilt zeggen dat je helemaal niet moe bent kan niet een beetje nah zeggen.",Dutch

het is het niet waard.,Dutch

"het is het niet waard, ik ben persoonlijk dol op de zin die je rockt, wat betekent dat je geweldig bent.",Dutch
O mijn God.,Dutch
jij rock je rock?,Dutch
"nee, je hebt geweldig werk verricht.",Dutch
"je rockt als iemand niet echt goed werkt, en je wilt dat ze harder werken, je kunt zeggen dat je een extra mijl moet gaan, wat betekent dat je net als harder moet werken, een extra mijl moet doen.",Dutch

Ik ben niet geïnteresseerd.,Dutch
"Het kan me niet schelen als iemand je iets vraagt ​​en dit is een heel gemakkelijke beslissing voor je, zoals iemand zegt dat je mijn 1 miljoen dollar neemt en je zegt dat dit een no-brainer is.",Dutch
Ik neem het.,Dutch
"dit is een no-brainer, wat betekent dat het een heel gemakkelijke beslissing voor je is als je iets verkeerd hebt gedaan en je geeft toe dat je kunt zeggen dat ik het verpest heb, ja jongens.",Dutch

het gouden brood Er was eens in een klein dorpje een vrouw die Marion heette.,Dutch
"met haar enige dochter was narcisa marion buitengewoon nederig en lieve narcisa was echter helemaal het tegenovergestelde, je ziet dat ze mooi was zonder woorden, ze was als een leven.",Dutch
"pop en het meest grappige is dat ze oneindig veel van zichzelf hield, narcisa zou je.",Dutch
"help me het brood bakken he, mam, de meelmeisjes al mijn heldere en sprankelende ogen.",Dutch
"narcisa wil je me helpen deze zaden te planten wat waarom zou ik dat doen wat heb ik al dat vuil op mijn mooie vingers erger wat als het goed op mijn gezicht ging, dat was het probleem met narcisa.",Dutch
ze vond zichzelf te geweldig om wat voor werk dan ook te doen.,Dutch
Veel vrijers kwamen om narcissen te vragen.,Dutch
"omdat haar schoonheid wijd en zijd bekend was, maar ze ze allemaal heel grof afgewezen, waarom heb je die mannen gisteren weggestuurd, ze leken aardig, je kunt niet serieus zijn, mama een van hen.",Dutch
had zulke kleine ogen bijna als die van een vogel en de ander had een enorme neus dat ik niet bij hem in de buurt zou willen zijn.,Dutch
"toen hij niesde oh oh en de laatste stop nee ik wil niet meer horen, alles wat ik kon zien was dat die mannen echt aardig waren mijn liefste, je moet die schoonheid kennen.",Dutch
is niet alles moeder je moet beseffen dat ik iemand verdien als een prins of een ridder.,Dutch
"oh lieverd op een nacht toen ze sliep, zat haar moeder naast haar en keek naar haar.",Dutch
"mijn lieve kind, je bent zo mooi en lief, maar je geeft niks anders dan je schoonheid.",Dutch
op dat moment begon narcissus te lachen in haar slaap haar moeder was buitengewoon verrast hoe leuk ze de volgende ochtend een heel grappige droom moet hebben als narcis.,Dutch
Ik werd wakker.,Dutch
Ze glimlachte en giechelde hier lieverd vertel me waar je van droomde.,Dutch
"gisteravond nou mam, het was zo'n geweldige droom, weet je, er was een prins die naar me toe kwam.",Dutch
"en zei dat hij met me wilde trouwen, hij was in een gouden koets gekomen en hij was van boven tot onder gekleed en ook goud wat een dwaze droom.",Dutch
en je weet dat het beste ervan was toen ik mijn trouwjurk droeg die ook van goud was.,Dutch
Natuurlijk staarde iedereen alleen naar mij.,Dutch
narcisa er is niets verbazingwekkends aan die droom.,Dutch
"het was een erg egoïstische droom moeder, je weet niet wat je zegt, die droom heeft me doen beseffen dat ik veel grootser voedsel nodig heb dan het soort dat ik hier thuis eet, brood gemaakt van goud.",Dutch
Denk maar aan die arme narcis-moeder die zich zo zorgen maakte over haar dochter en hoe.,Dutch
ze zou die dag haar leven leiden.,Dutch
Twee vriendinnen kwamen op bezoek bij de moeder van de narcis.,Dutch
Ze waren mellie en badstof.,Dutch
"Ze waren alle drie al heel lang vrienden, maar badstof en ellie hadden allebei een geheim.",Dutch
waren magische wezens iets waarvan de moeder van narcisse niets wist van terry melli oh het is zo goed om je te zien het is erg lang geleden hoe gaat het met je ik ben heel goed geweest ik zou beter zijn geweest als alleen maar wat als mijn dochter narcisa een beetje meer begrip had marian vertelde mellie en badstof alles over narcisa en hoe ze zich zorgen maakte om haar ze wil eten brood gemaakt van goud wat moet ik met haar doen nou misschien als haar droom uitkomt.,Dutch
"dat zou geweldig zijn, zou het niet goed zijn, ik denk dat ze na verloop van tijd zal groeien om te leren, laten we over iets anders praten.",Dutch
nu later zwaaiden Mellie en Terry hun oude vriend gedag en gingen die avond zowel moeder als dochter lachend naar elkaar weg.,Dutch
klaarmaken voor bed moeder ik hoop echt dat mijn droom uitkomt weet je oh narcisa de volgende dag als narcisa en haar moeder waren buiten in hun tuin een prachtige.,Dutch
"gouden koets kwam aanrijden, bezaaid met edelstenen en diamanten en zag er buitengewoon verbluffend uit.",Dutch
toen het stopte kwam er een knappe man tevoorschijn en keek naar narcisa.,Dutch
Ze was helemaal verbaasd over hoe knap hij was.,Dutch
Mijn droom komt echt uit umm.,Dutch
"wat hallo ik ben hier gekomen om narcissushand in het huwelijk te vragen, maar hoe weet je haar naam en wie ben jij.",Dutch
"ik ben terrence de engel van het geluk de naam en de schoonheid van je dochter is over de hele wereld bekend hier ik heb je een geschenk meegebracht, maar je kent hem nauwelijks, je kunt niet met hem meegaan.",Dutch
oh dom hij is rijk en knap wat wil ik nog meer terrence ik accepteer je voorstel.,Dutch
"en daarmee stapte ze in zijn rijtuig en zonder zelfs maar afscheid te nemen van haar moeder reed het rijtuig weg met de engel terwijl ze aan het reizen waren, ging het rijtuig plotseling een magisch portaal binnen, daar reisde het door een stormachtig gebied, het rijtuig botste enorm rond en narcis.",Dutch
"was erg bang, maak je geen zorgen mijn liefste, dit alles zal snel voorbij zijn, net zoals hij dit zei, het rijtuig ging door een ander portaal en bereikte de oprit.",Dutch
"van een enorm en prachtig gouden kasteel narcisa was verbaasd over al het moois dat ze zag ik wist dat ik zoveel rijkdom verdien ik wist dat je het leuk zou vinden alles wat je wilt vind je hier van de mooiste jurken tot het lekkerste eten allemaal in mijn paleis goed sprekend over eten ik heb echt honger na die rit ik ' m uitgehongerd mag ik iets van dat lekkere eten natuurlijk hier vlees stinkende melissa ze zal je krijgen wat je maar wilt ik heb zoveel over je gehoord je arm schat je hebt honger, kom je niet, laten we naar de eettafel gaan en ik zal wat eten voor je halen, oh dank je, ze gingen naar de eetkamer en daar op de tafel stond het meest verbazingwekkende voedsel dat narcisa ooit had gezien, geweldig, dat komt omdat de jam wordt gemaakt.",Dutch
van robijnen de salades van smaragden en het brood daar is gemaakt van goudgoud brood hoe mooi deze jam eruit zal zien en heerlijk zal smaken met het brood ze nam een ​​sneetje erbij.,Dutch
"robijnrode jam erop en nam een ​​enorme hap dit is zo heet ik kan niet zo goed eten het is brood van goud en het beste ook maar als je het niet kunt eten moet ik je zilver brood zilver geven he, waarom niet jij eet.",Dutch
"iets anders maar ik wil gewoon brood brood dat ik kan eten, heb je niet die look zo aanstaande vrouw van mijn vader, het is koud je moet alleen de beste narcis eten.",Dutch
Ik heb naar al het eten gekeken.,Dutch
maar was diepbedroefd voor alles wat er oneetbaar was.,Dutch
"Ze begon al snel te huilen, ik wil dit niet, maar het eten is echt goed.",Dutch
"probeer hier wat gouden aardappelen, ze zijn echt goed en nadat je met mij bent getrouwd.",Dutch
je moet dit allemaal opeten.,Dutch
Ik dacht dat je van mooie dingen hield.,Dutch
"Nee, ik wil niet met je trouwen.",Dutch
Ik wil naar huis.,Dutch
naar mijn moeder laat me naar huis gaan melissa en terrence keken elkaar aan en knipogen goed.,Dutch
"als dat echt is wat je wilt, dan neem ik je mee naar huis.",Dutch
Terrence nam het huilen en ongelukkig op.,Dutch
narcis thuis in de koets begon ze diep na te denken over de keuzes die ze had gemaakt toen ze thuiskwam.,Dutch
"ze rende om haar moeder te omhelzen die in het huis zat, verdrietig, noch zus o mijn lieve dochter, ik dacht dat ik je nooit meer zou zien.",Dutch
oh mam ik hou zo veel van je en je had gelijk uiterlijk en rijkdom is niet alles het gouden brood was nutteloos omdat ik het niet kon eten en de man ook al.,Dutch
hij was knap hij gaf helemaal niet om me maar mijn liefste besef je dat dat precies de manier is waarop je anderen behandelde.,Dutch
"Ik weet dat het me zo spijt van de manier waarop ik me gedroeg mam oh nee het is goed sinds je het hebt gezien wat je fout was, kom, laten we je vanaf die dag iets lekkers geven.",Dutch
"narcisa veranderde haar manier van doen ze worstelde eerst maar langzaam en geduldig begon ze een stuk aardiger te worden op een dag dat mellie en badstof marian weer kwamen ontmoeten oh hallo jullie twee, dus vertel het ons marian.",Dutch
hoe' Marian vertelde hun nu allebei alles wat er was gebeurd en ze is sinds die tijd zo veranderd.,Dutch
"heeft ze, denk ik dat ze nu geen goudbrood meer zou willen, weet je.",Dutch
"Terry je lijkt eigenlijk een beetje op die engel, maar wat zie ik, hoe kun je hem zijn jullie twee zijn zo aardig",Dutch
"Nature es una de las más prestigiosas revistas científicas a nivel mundial,[1]​ que fue fundada por Joseph Norman Lockyer.",Spanish
Su primer número fue publicado el 4 de noviembre de 1869.,Spanish
"[2]​ Con una periodicidad semanal, la revista es publicada en Reino Unido por la compañía Nature Publishing Group, subsidiaria de Macmillan Publishers, propiedad del Grupo Editorial Holtzbrinck (dueños del semanario Die Zeit).",Spanish
"Nature tiene oficinas en Londres, Nueva York, San Francisco, Washington D. C., Tokio, París, Múnich y Basingstoke, y dispone de corresponsales propios en la mayoría de los países industrializados.",Spanish
"La editorial publica también varias revistas especializadas bajo el nombre de Nature como Nature Neuroscience, Nature Methods y Nature Structural and Molecular Biology entre otros títulos.",Spanish
La revista es leída por científicos e investigadores de todo el mundo siendo la mayor parte de los artículos exposiciones de trabajos de investigación muy técnicos.,Spanish
"Sin embargo también incluye editoriales y noticias científicas de carácter general así como artículos sobre política científica en diferentes países, críticas de libros técnicos y de divulgación y artículos sobre la historia y el futuro de algunas disciplinas científicas.",Spanish
"Según los Journal Citation Reports, la revista tiene un factor de impacto de 41,456.",Spanish
[3]​ Para la mayoría de los científicos publicar en Nature constituye una marca de prestigio.,Spanish
La revista rechaza en torno al 95% de los artículos que le son enviados para la revisión por pares.,Spanish
[4]​ Los artículos publicados aparecen en ocasiones reseñados por la prensa general y se considera que se encuentran en el frente de la investigación científica.,Spanish
"Algunos artículos famosos publicados por Nature fueron: En 2007 fue galardonada con el Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Comunicación y Humanidades, junto con la revista Science, «por su labor durante más de un siglo impulsando y difundiendo las grandes conquistas científicas de la Humanidad acercando de este modo la ciencia a la vida».",Spanish
[6]​ Los artículos publicados en Nature se someten a un riguroso sistema de arbitraje por expertos internacionales en cada área del conocimiento.,Spanish
Los artículos publicados han pasado el filtro de la revisión por pares.,Spanish
"En casos dudosos, algunos de los experimentos son repetidos por otros científicos confidencialmente antes de su publicación.",Spanish
Los editores de la revista realizan también una importante criba determinando si el artículo es o no de interés general y si está o no entre los temas de interés científico superior.,Spanish
"A pesar de todos estos filtros, algunos artículos publicados por la revista constituyeron famosos escándalos al demostrarse la falsedad de los resultados presentados.",Spanish
Tales fueron los casos de la memoria del agua o la fusión fría.,Spanish
"Wikipedia es una enciclopedia libre,[nota 2]​ políglota y editada de manera colaborativa.",Spanish
"Es administrada por la Fundación Wikimedia, una organización sin ánimo de lucro cuya financiación está basada en donaciones.",Spanish
"Sus más de 50 millones de artículos en 300 idiomas han sido redactados en conjunto por voluntarios de todo el mundo,[5]​ lo que suma más de 2000 millones de ediciones, y permite que cualquier persona pueda sumarse al proyecto[6]​ para editarlos, a menos que la página se encuentre protegida contra vandalismos para evitar problemas o disputas.",Spanish
"Fue creada el 15 de enero de 2001 por Jimmy Wales y Larry Sanger,[7]​ y es la mayor y más popular obra de consulta en Internet.",Spanish
"[8]​[9]​[10]​ Desde su fundación, Wikipedia no solo ha ganado en popularidad —se encuentra entre los 20 sitios web más populares del mundo—,[11]​[12]​ sino que además su éxito ha propiciado la aparición de proyectos hermanos: Wikcionario, Wikilibros, Wikiversidad, Wikiquote, Wikinoticias, Wikisource, Wikiespecies y Wikiviajes.",Spanish
Existen tres características esenciales del proyecto Wikipedia que definen en conjunto su función en la web.,Spanish
"El lema «La enciclopedia libre que todos pueden editar» explica los tres principios:[13]​ Según su cofundador, Jimmy Wales, el proyecto constituye «un esfuerzo para crear y distribuir una enciclopedia libre, de la más alta calidad posible, a cada persona del planeta, en su idioma», para lograr «un mundo en el que cada persona del planeta tenga acceso libre a la suma de todo el saber de la humanidad».",Spanish
[14]​ Se desarrolla en el sitio Wikipedia.org haciendo uso de un software wiki —término originalmente usado para el WikiWikiWeb—.,Spanish
Wikipedia ha recibido diversas críticas.,Spanish
"Algunos la han acusado de parcialidad sistémica y de inconsistencias,[15]​ con críticas sobre la política del proyecto enciclopédico de favorecer el consenso sobre las credenciales en su proceso editorial[16]​[17]​ Otras críticas han estado centradas en su susceptibilidad de ser vandalizada y en la aparición de información espuria o falta de verificación,[18]​ aunque estudios eruditos sugieren que el vandalismo en general es deshecho con prontitud.",Spanish
"[19]​[20]​ De las 300 ediciones, diecisiete superan el 1 000 000 de artículos: inglés, cebuano, sueco, alemán,  francés, neerlandés, ruso, italiano, español, polaco, samareño, vietnamita, japonés, chino, árabe, portugués y ucraniano.",Spanish
"[nota 3]​ Una buena parte de sus ediciones idiomáticas está disponible para ser utilizada offline, distribuida en DVD u otros soportes.",Spanish
[21]​ Muchas de sus ediciones han sido replicadas a través de Internet —mediante «espejos»— y han dado origen a enciclopedias derivadas —bifurcaciones— en otros sitios web.,Spanish
"[22]​ Wikipedia ha sido criticada por exhibir sesgos sistémicos y por estar sujeta a manipulación y giro en temas controvertidos;[23]​ Edwin Black ha criticado a Wikipedia por presentar una mezcla de ""verdad, verdad a medias y algunas falsedades"".",Spanish
"[24]​ Wikipedia también ha sido criticada por prejuicios de género, particularmente en su versión en inglés, donde la mayoría de los editores son hombres.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, se han realizado maratones de edición para alentar a las editoras y aumentar la cobertura de temas relacionados con la mujer.",Spanish
[25]​ Facebook anunció que para 2017 ayudaría a los lectores a detectar noticias falsas sugiriendo enlaces a artículos relacionados de Wikipedia.,Spanish
YouTube anunció un plan similar en 2018.,Spanish
"[26]​ Es uno de los 15 sitios web más populares según la clasificación de Alexa, en enero de 2021 y la revista The Economist la colocó como el ""decimotercer lugar más visitado en la web"".",Spanish
"[27]​ Sin publicidad, está alojado por la Fundación Wikimedia, una organización estadounidense sin fines de lucro financiada principalmente a través de donaciones.",Spanish
"[28]​ Wales cita el ensayo ""El uso del conocimiento en la sociedad"", escrito por el economista y filósofo de la escuela austriaca y Premio Nobel de Economía Friedrich Hayek, que leyó cuando era estudiante,[29]​ como «central» para su pensamiento acerca de «cómo gestionar el proyecto Wikipedia»[30]​[31]​[32]​[33]​ Hayek argumenta que la información está descentralizada —cada individuo solo conoce una pequeña fracción de lo que se conoce colectivamente— y, como resultado, las decisiones se toman mejor por aquellos con conocimientos locales, en lugar de por una autoridad central.",Spanish
"[30]​[34]​ Wales reconsideró el ensayo de Hayek en la década de 1990, mientras estaba leyendo sobre el movimiento de código abierto, que abogaba por la distribución gratuita de software libre.",Spanish
"Fue particularmente conmovido por el ensayo ""La catedral y el bazar"" escrito por uno de los fundadores del movimiento, Eric S. Raymond y adaptado más adelante en un libro.",Spanish
Wales afirmó que ese ensayo «abrió [sus] ojos a las posibilidades de colaboración masiva».,Spanish
"[29]​ En marzo de 2000, Jimmy Wales creó Nupedia, un proyecto de enciclopedia libre basado en un ambicioso y exhaustivo proceso de revisión por pares,[35]​ diseñado para hacer sus artículos de una calidad comparable a la de las enciclopedias profesionales gracias a la participación de eruditos –principalmente doctorandos y académicos—, a los que se proponía colaborar de modo no remunerado.",Spanish
"El proyecto tuvo el apoyo económico de la empresa Bomis, fundada por Wales y administrada por este junto con un compañero desde 1996,[36]​ y la colaboración de Richard Stallman, quien propuso el cambio a la licencia pública general de GNU, desde la antigua Nupedia Open Content License.",Spanish
"[37]​ Larry Sanger, doctor en filosofía, que ya conocía anteriormente a Wales de mantener con él discusiones filosóficas por Internet, fue contratado por este y se convirtió en redactor jefe de Nupedia.",Spanish
"[36]​ Debido al lento avance del proyecto, en 2001 se creó un wiki —UseMod— vinculado a Nupedia cuya finalidad inicial era agilizar la creación de artículos de forma paralela, antes de que estos pasaran al sistema de revisión por expertos.",Spanish
"Existe cierta polémica entre los fundadores de Nupedia sobre quién propuso originalmente la idea de usar un wiki a Jimbo Wales, si Larry Sanger o bien una tercera persona,[38]​ pero el caso es que el éxito de aquel «pequeño proyecto paralelo» —Wikipedia— acabó eclipsando a Nupedia, que dejó de funcionar en 2003.",Spanish
El proyecto Wikipedia se inició el 15 de enero de 2001.,Spanish
"El artículo más antiguo que puede encontrarse en Wikipedia es UuU, creado el 16 de enero de 2001 en la versión inglesa; consistía en tres enlaces hacia sendos artículos sobre el Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y Uruguay.",Spanish
"[39]​
Larry Sanger pasó a colaborar con Wikipedia y trabajó activamente en la organización y directrices del proyecto; se marchó en 2002 por desacuerdos con Wales.",Spanish
"[36]​ Ese año, Wikipedia abarcaba 26 idiomas, 46 en 2003 y 161 a finales de 2004.",Spanish
Wikipedia y Nupedia coexistieron hasta la extinción de la segunda en 2003.,Spanish
"[40]​
Sin embargo, la posibilidad de utilizar publicidad en Wikipedia provocó una reacción de parte de los contribuyentes de la Wikipedia en español, motivo que llevó a la creación de la Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español en febrero de 2002.",Spanish
"[41]​ Este episodio podría haber impulsado a su vez la determinación de no utilizar publicidad, la creación de la Fundación Wikimedia y el cambio al nuevo url.",Spanish
"[42]​ Se han iniciado otros varios proyectos de enciclopedia con formato wiki, en gran parte bajo una filosofía diferente de la apertura y el modelo editorial del «punto de vista neutral» desarrollado por Wikipedia.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, Wikinfo, uno de los portales web, no requiere un punto de vista neutral y permite la investigación original.",Spanish
"[43]​ También hubo nuevos proyectos inspirados en Wikipedia —como Citizendium, Scholarpedia, Conservapedia, y Knol de Google[44]​— donde algunos de los aspectos que son fundamentales en Wikipedia se abordan de manera diferenciada, como las políticas de revisión por pares, la investigación original, y la publicidad comercial.",Spanish
"El 20 de septiembre de 2004, Wikipedia alcanzó 1 millón de artículos en 100 idiomas.",Spanish
"[45]​ En 2007 la versión en inglés superó los 2 millones de artículos, convirtiéndose en la enciclopedia con mayor número de artículos de la historia y superando en ese aspecto a la Yongle Dadian de 1407, que sostuvo el récord durante varios siglos.",Spanish
"[46]​ Debido a su popularidad y sencillez, el Oxford English Dictionary ha considerado introducir el término wiki.",Spanish
"[47]​ En octubre de 2011, Wikimedia anunció el lanzamiento de Wikipedia Zero, una iniciativa para permitir el acceso gratuito móvil (datos) a la Wikipedia en países del tercer mundo a través de colaboraciones con operadores de telecomunicaciones móviles.",Spanish
"[48]​[49]​ La palabra Wikipedia, nombre propio acuñado por Larry Sanger a principios de 2001, es la contracción de wiki, una tecnología para crear sitios web colaborativos, procedente a su vez de wikiwiki, 'rápido' en hawaiano,[50]​ y encyclopedia, 'enciclopedia' en inglés.",Spanish
[51]​ Este nombre se pronuncia en inglés como  [ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdi.ə] (?·i) o AFI: [ˌwɪkiˈpiːdi.ə] (AFI).,Spanish
"La Wikipedia en español, creada meses después, heredó el nombre.",Spanish
"Tras una votación realizada entre septiembre y noviembre de 2003 por parte de los usuarios de esta, se decidió seguir con el mismo término.",Spanish
"En la votación se barajaron los siguientes nombres —por orden de popularidad—: Librepedia, Huiquipedia, Uiquipedia, Güiquipedia, Viquipedia, Ñiquipedia, Velozpedia, Limonpedia, Güisquipedia y Velocipedia.",Spanish
"[52]​ Otros que también usaron el nombre Wikipedia fueron los idiomas —ordenados según el ISO 639-3—: alemán, bretón, corso, danés, euskera, filipino, finlandés, gallego, neerlandés, indonesio, islandés, italiano, nauruano, noruego, polaco, rumano, siciliano, somalí, suajili y sueco.",Spanish
Esta es una lista de las grafías alternativas usadas para nombrar a Wikipedia en las diferentes ediciones:[53]​ Nota: Cada asterisco (*) denota una referencia respectiva por la múltiple adopción lingüística.,Spanish
"Desde su inicio en 2001, Wikipedia ha utilizado diferentes marcas corporativas.",Spanish
"El elemento común en todas ellas es una esfera escrita como elemento central, simbolizando el mundo y el conocimiento.",Spanish
"En 2003 se adoptó por concurso internacional el dibujo de una esfera incompleta, conocida como globo-rompecabezas, compuesta por piezas de un rompecabezas de varios colores, con enlaces en azul pertenecientes a distintas escrituras del mundo, simbolizando así la condición de «obra en construcción» que tiene Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[54]​ El diseño que ganó el concurso internacional sufrió algunas modificaciones antes de ser aprobado como logo oficial, principalmente la eliminación del color y el reemplazo de los enlaces por grafemas de diversas escrituras del mundo.",Spanish
La denuncia de diversos errores e inconsistencias en los símbolos incluidos en el globo-rompecabezas y la posibilidad de diseñar una imagen animada o fotorrealista impulsó entre diversos editores de Wikipedia un debate sobre la posibilidad de realizar modificaciones en el elemento gráfico.,Spanish
"Como consecuencia, y tras la labor realizada a través de una iniciativa de la Fundación Wikimedia junto a miles de voluntarios para modificar la interfaz de la enciclopedia, el dibujo de la globo-rompecabezas fue reemplazado en 2010 por un modelo tridimensional, en el que algunos símbolos de las piezas de rompecabezas fueron reemplazados por otros, principalmente aquellos que constituyen el primer grafema de la palabra ""Wikipedia"" en distintas wikipedias que existen en el mundo.",Spanish
"Por añadidura, se cambió la tipografía del elemento denominativo —«WIKIPEDIA, La enciclopedia libre»— para usar la fuente abierta Linux Libertine, con excepción de la W inicial, que se mantiene con la fuente Hoefler Text y constituye también uno de los símbolos oficiales.",Spanish
[55]​[56]​[57]​ Cada Wikipedia según idioma es autónoma y tiene facultades para elegir la marca que la identifique.,Spanish
"A partir de 2003 todas han adoptado básicamente la misma, con el elemento denominativo «Wikipedia, The free encyclopedia» —«Wikipedia, La enciclopedia libre»— traducido al idioma en que se escribe cada una.",Spanish
"Las marcas han sido realizadas voluntaria y gratuitamente por usuarios de Wikipedia, y sus derechos pertenecen a la Fundación Wikimedia.",Spanish
"Han existido y existen muchas enciclopedias en línea que compitieron con Wikipedia, como Microsoft Encarta y Encyclopædia Britannica; sin embargo, ninguna ha logrado el mismo éxito que Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[59]​[60]​ Wikipedia busca crear un resumen de todo el conocimiento humano, con cada tema cubierto enciclopédicamente en un artículo.",Spanish
"Como tiene terabytes de espacio disponible, puede abarcar muchos más temas que cualquier enciclopedia impresa.",Spanish
"El grado exacto y la forma de cobertura en Wikipedia se encuentran en constante revisión por parte de sus editores, y los desacuerdos no son infrecuentes, tal como lo demuestra la controversia sobre eliminación de contenidos.",Spanish
"[61]​[62]​ Según un estudio realizado por la revista Nature en 2007, «Wikipedia alcanzaba a la Enciclopedia Británica» en calidad,[63]​ aunque existe controversia sobre este asunto.",Spanish
"[64]​[65]​ Además, sus contenidos están disponibles en formato impreso.",Spanish
"[66]​[67]​ Otro estudio realizado por la Universidad Carnegie Mellon y Palo Alto Research Center sobre las mayores categorías de artículos en la Wikipedia en inglés desde julio de 2006 hasta enero de 2008, arrojó los siguientes resultados:[68]​ Para la visualización de artículos, la fundación Wikimedia rediseñó la interfaz con un tema o tapiz que se conoce como vector, creado en 2010.",Spanish
"[69]​[70]​ Antes de la actualización, años atrás existía una interfaz clásica conocida como Monobook con limitadas características.",Spanish
"[71]​ Dentro de la interfaz, existen variedad de mandos usados para navegar o editar páginas.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, para buscar, ir a otros enlaces o ampliar imágenes como otros sitios web.",Spanish
"Además, mediante las pestañas, pueden navegar, interaccionar o colaborar con otras páginas.",Spanish
"Aunque algunas actividades de mantenimiento, son ocultas para los usuarios no registrados en el proyecto.",Spanish
"Para editar un artículo se recurre al código wiki en una caja de texto a través de la pestaña ""Editar"" que no siempre está disponible en caso de alguna prevención contra el vandalismo.",Spanish
"Entre sus mandos, no se asemejan al clásico HTML; por ejemplo para los enlaces se usan corchetes, signos iguales para los títulos, entre otros, lo cual puede dar una mala impresión a aquellas personas que no tengan conocimientos en Informática.",Spanish
"[72]​ En octubre de 2016, Wikipedia abarcaba 284 ediciones «activas» en distintos idiomas y dialectos.",Spanish
"Cada edición trabaja de forma independiente, no está obligada a incluir el contenido de otras ediciones, y solo debe respetar políticas globales tales como la de mantener un «punto de vista neutral».",Spanish
"Sin embargo, se comparten algunos artículos e imágenes entre las diversas ediciones de Wikipedia o a través del repositorio de Wikimedia Commons, y se solicitan traducciones organizadas de artículos procedentes de otras ediciones.",Spanish
Los artículos traducidos representan solamente una pequeña parte del total en cualquiera de ellas.,Spanish
"[73]​ Las cinco ediciones con más artículos son, en orden descendente, inglés, sueco, neerlandés, alemán y francés.",Spanish
"En enero de 2011, Wikipedia contenía 278 ediciones —268 activas— en varios estados de desarrollo, que sumaban más de 17 millones de artículos.",Spanish
"[5]​ La lista de idiomas incluye idiomas artificiales como el esperanto, lenguas indígenas o aborígenes como el náhuatl, el maya y las lenguas de las islas Andamán, o lenguas muertas, como el latín, el chino clásico o el anglosajón.",Spanish
"El 1 de marzo de 2006, la Wikipedia en inglés se convirtió en la primera en superar el millón de artículos, seguida el 27 de diciembre de 2009 por la Wikipedia en alemán, el 21 de septiembre de 2010 por la Wikipedia en francés, el 17 de diciembre de 2011 por la Wikipedia en neerlandés, el 22 de enero de 2013 por la Wikipedia en italiano, el 11 de mayo del mismo año por la Wikipedia en ruso, el 16 del mismo mes por la Wikipedia en español, el 15 de junio por la Wikipedia en sueco y el 24 de septiembre por la Wikipedia en polaco.",Spanish
"Durante la primera mitad de 2014, alcanzaron también el millón de artículos tres ediciones en lenguas asiáticas: la Wikipedia en vietnamita, la Wikipedia en samareño y la Wikipedia en cebuano.",Spanish
La siguiente es una lista de las dieciséis mayores ediciones ordenadas por número de artículos.,Spanish
"Las cifras, que son referenciadas respectivamente a cada versión, son actuales.",Spanish
"Muchas ediciones de Wikipedia —como la sueca, la neerlandesa y la rusa— utilizan bots para la creación automática de esbozos, razón por la que el número de artículos no es necesariamente una referencia válida con respecto a su estado o calidad.",Spanish
"[75]​[76]​ Una categorización diferente sería la media de tamaño por artículo; así, una Wikipedia con numerosos artículos de apenas unos pocos bytes quedaría situada por debajo de otra con menos entradas pero más trabajadas.",Spanish
"También hay que tener en cuenta que muchas Wikipedias —como, por ejemplo, la rusa, la japonesa, la china y la hebrea— usan alfabetos no latinos, silabarios o sistemas ideográmicos, y ello aumenta el tamaño de las bases de datos.",Spanish
Países desde donde se editan los artículos.,Spanish
"Según estadísticas de Wikipedia, en 2020 ingresan mensualmente al sitio unos 1600 millones de dispositivos, tomando el promedio de los últimos doce meses.",Spanish
"[79]​ Aparte del sitio web, se han elaborado otras versiones alternativas que cumplen la misión de visualizar artículos a pesar de las críticas a la censura de artículos.",Spanish
"En agosto de 2009, la Fundación Wikimedia lanzó una aplicación oficial de Wikipedia para el iPhone y el iPod Touch que se puede descargar de la App Store.",Spanish
"Esta aplicación es libre, gratuita y solo funciona en el iPhone 3G o en versiones más recientes.",Spanish
[80]​ También hay versión para Android.,Spanish
"[81]​ En cuanto a acceso mediante sitio web, ya existían alternativas como el sitio Wapedia; sin embargo, Wikipedia cuenta con su propia versión móvil del sitio, disponible en línea.",Spanish
"Otras versiones publicadas por la Fundación Wikimedia fueron las distribuciones en soporte físico sobre CD (2003) y DVD (2005), en las cuales se incluían las versiones en alemán, polaco, portugués e inglés.",Spanish
Esto se hace mediante el software libre Kiwix que permite su instalación directa.,Spanish
"Estas características permiten que sea posible ser usadas en computadoras sin conexión a internet, permitiendo la interactividad y comunicación entre diferentes puestos como por ejemplo centros infantiles.",Spanish
[82]​ En Wikipedia hay servicios que ofrecen la versión impresa.,Spanish
MediaWiki ha incorporado una herramienta de recolección para exportar artículos a ODF o PDF.,Spanish
"[83]​ También existe la posibilidad de imprimir libros vía PediaPress, un programa socio de la fundación Wikimedia, mediante la misma solicitud.",Spanish
"[84]​ Desde octubre de 2005, China había bloqueado el acceso a Wikipedia, pues el gobierno bloquea habitualmente el acceso a los sitios web que considera subversivos y filtra las páginas de Internet con términos que considera delicados.",Spanish
"[85]​ Un año después, Wikipedia fue desbloqueada en el territorio chino, aunque la censura se mantuvo parcialmente con los términos «sensibles», tales como Tíbet o Falun Gong.",Spanish
"[86]​ En 2008, varios centros educativos de los Estados Unidos prohibieron el uso de Wikipedia desde sus instalaciones por considerarla poco fiable.",Spanish
"[87]​ También en el mismo año, 160 000 usuarios solicitaron a través del sitio web Care 2 la retirada de las imágenes sobre Mahoma en los artículos de Wikipedia.",Spanish
En este caso la petición fue rechazada.,Spanish
"[88]​ En octubre de 2011, debido a la aprobación de la ley mordaza, la Wikipedia en italiano tuvo que suspender las actividades por temor a la severas multas que ejecutarían en sus contenidos biográficos.",Spanish
"[89]​ De manera similar, en enero de 2012, la versión inglesa se autocensuró para protestar a la ley SOPA durante un día entero.",Spanish
"Uno de los delegados de Twitter, Dick Costolo, consideró al sitio web que «cerrar un negocio global por un solo asunto de política nacional es una locura».",Spanish
"[90]​[91]​ La comunidad de Wikipedia es una red de voluntarios, a veces conocidos como «wikipedistas» y a veces simplemente llamados «usuarios», que hacen aportaciones a la enciclopedia en línea Wikipedia.",Spanish
Existe una jerarquía por la que ciertos editores son elegidos para tener mayor control editorial de los miembros de la comunidad.,Spanish
"Emigh y Herring sostienen que «unos pocos usuarios activos, cuando actúan en concierto con las normas establecidas dentro de un sistema de edición abierta, pueden alcanzar el máximo control sobre el contenido producido dentro del sistema, literalmente borrando la diversidad, la controversia y la inconsistencia, y homogeneizando las voces de los contribuyentes».",Spanish
[92]​ La comunidad también ha sido criticada por responder a las quejas sobre la calidad de un artículo aconsejando a las personas que se quejan a arreglar el artículo por sí mismos.,Spanish
"[93]​ El profesor James H. Fetzer ha criticado a Wikipedia en que no podía cambiar el artículo sobre sí mismo;[94]​ para garantizar la imparcialidad, la Wikipedia tiene una política que desalienta la edición de biografías de los sujetos mismos salvo en ""casos claros"", como revertir el vandalismo o correcciones sobre desactualización o datos erróneos.",Spanish
"[95]​ La comunidad ha sido descrita como ""de culto"",[96]​[97]​[98]​ aunque no siempre con connotaciones negativas del todo.",Spanish
[99]​ Wikipedia no requiere que sus usuarios se identifiquen.,Spanish
"Esto significa que varias personas pueden utilizar una cuenta o, más frecuentemente, una persona puede utilizar varias cuentas, a menudo en un intento de influir en el contenido de los artículos, o ayudar a crear consenso en las disputas editoriales.",Spanish
"[100]​[101]​ La última práctica se conoce como ""usuarios títeres"", que se desalienta activamente en la Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[102]​ Proyectos como Wikipedia, Susning.nu o la Enciclopedia Libre son wikis en los que los artículos son desarrollados por numerosos autores, y no existe un criterio de revisión formal.",Spanish
Wikipedia es la enciclopedia más grande en cuanto a número de artículos o palabras jamás escrita.,Spanish
"Al contrario de lo que sucede con muchas otras, su contenido está liberado bajo licencias de contenido abierto.",Spanish
"En el caso de Wikipedia en español, cualquier persona tiene la posibilidad de crear un artículo nuevo y casi cualquier visitante puede editar el contenido, a excepción de los artículos que se encuentran protegidos.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, en la inglesa los usuarios no registrados no pueden comenzar artículos desde cero.",Spanish
"Wikipedia fue creada con la idea de producir textos de calidad a partir de la colaboración entre usuarios, a semejanza de los proyectos de desarrollo de aplicaciones libres.",Spanish
"Los artículos evolucionan con el paso del tiempo, y esto es visible en su historial de ediciones.",Spanish
"Habitualmente, una parte de las ediciones son vandálicas —de contenido no relacionado con Wikipedia o con información falsa—, y en ocasiones editores con puntos de vista encontrados producen lo que se conoce como guerra de ediciones.",Spanish
Esta se produce cuando dos o más editores entran en un ciclo de reversiones mutuas debido a disputas causadas por diferencias de opinión sobre el contenido del artículo.,Spanish
"No hay que confundir vandalismo —que frecuentemente afecta una sola vez a un artículo o artículos— con guerra de ediciones, la cual afecta repetidas veces a un mismo artículo en un breve lapso.",Spanish
"Entre los artículos vandalizados frecuentemente en la edición en español destacan: George W. Bush, Benedicto XVI o Testigos de Jehová; mientras que artículos con fuertes guerras de ediciones son Cuba o Comunidad Valenciana, debido a la disparidad entre las opiniones de sus redactores.",Spanish
"Cada capítulo de Wikipedia cuenta con un grupo de personal, encargado en la cooperación.",Spanish
"Dentro de esta lista se mencionan a administradores, cuyas funciones fundamentales son hacer mantenimiento —tal como borrar artículos, bloquear vándalos y otras funciones— y estar al servicio del cumplimiento de las normas que la rigen.",Spanish
"El capítulo con más administradores es la Wikipedia en inglés, con un total de más de 1600.",Spanish
"[104]​ Debido a su considerable popularidad, existieron propuestas de mascotas que representaban a Wikipedia de una manera no oficial.",Spanish
"La primera en aparecer fue la de Wikípedo, una hormiga trabajadora dedicada al mantenimiento de sus contribuciones.",Spanish
[105]​ Su popularidad fue poca.,Spanish
"En 2004, en una votación para ser remplazada o abandonada, la comunidad eligió a Wikipe-tan, un personaje tipo OS-tan dibujada por un usuario diseñador gráfico para un proyecto de anime y manga.",Spanish
"[106]​ No obstante, ha sido criticada por ser sexuada, considerado ofensivo por partes de la comunidad.",Spanish
"[107]​[108]​[109]​ Wikipedia tiene una serie de políticas establecidas por los propios participantes, cuya finalidad conjunta es mantener la identidad del proyecto como enciclopedia y promover la calidad de sus contenidos.",Spanish
"Cada capítulo de Wikipedia adopta sus propias políticas, aunque algunas son comunes a todos ellos.",Spanish
"Una vez que la comunidad logra el consenso sobre la aplicación de una norma, todos los editores están obligados a respetarla.",Spanish
Algunas de estas políticas son: Wikipedia es un proyecto dirigido a —literalmente— todo el mundo y editable por —literalmente— cualquier persona.,Spanish
"Esta característica constituye una de sus mayores ventajas, pero también genera un problema: existen personas que introducen —deliberadamente o no— información parcial, bien creando un planteamiento sesgado, o bien omitiendo puntos de vista que no comparten o que no les interesan.",Spanish
"[110]​ La política que se encarga de combatir dicho problema es el punto de vista neutral, que, básicamente, establece la necesidad absoluta e innegociable de reunir en los artículos susceptibles de polémica todos los puntos de vista significativos.",Spanish
"Además, las licencias de contenido libre garantizan que dicho contenido pueda ser reeditado cuantas veces sea necesario y por cualquier persona si el propósito de la edición es la mejora.",Spanish
"Según Jimmy Wales, uno de los fundadores de Wikipedia, la colaboración produce efectos positivos y ampliamente aceptados.",Spanish
"[111]​ Para el ingeniero informático formado en filosofía Joaquín Siabra Fraile, Wikipedia es primero un conjunto de reglas y procedimientos y, solo después, contenidos, las reglas son un mecanismo virtual diseñado para conseguir unos contenidos fruto del consenso racional.",Spanish
"Para Siabra se dan en el wikipedista lo que Habermas consideraba como criterios del participante en una situación ideal de comunicación: verdad, rectitud y veracidad.",Spanish
"[112]​[113]​ Wikipedia, debido a su condición de enciclopedia electrónica sin ánimo de lucro y en crecimiento permanente tanto en lo referente a su contenido como a su número de editores —cuya inmensa mayoría colabora de forma altruista—, admite información que no tendría cabida en una enciclopedia convencional, limitada esta última por el espacio físico —número de tomos— en el que se confina dicha información, por el número de editores contratados por la editorial y por el tiempo dedicado a confeccionar la obra.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, no toda la información tiene cabida, y existen criterios de relevancia establecidos por consenso comunitario, de tal modo que, aunque no se rechaza a priori ningún artículo, se investigan las nuevas creaciones y se descartan las que no cumplen determinados requisitos.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, no se admiten los artículos autopromocionales; esto es, que ninguna persona puede publicar un artículo sobre sí misma, sobre una persona cercana —familiar, por ejemplo— o sobre la empresa en la que trabaja.",Spanish
"Cuando el tema goza de una mínima —y necesaria— relevancia, llega a captar la atención de —cuando menos— algún medio de comunicación —libro, revista, periódico— reputado, y es a estos últimos a los que, según las normas de Wikipedia, debe acudirse para crear el artículo.",Spanish
"Estos criterios están contemplados en varias políticas, a saber, «Páginas de autopromoción»,[114]​ «Criterios para el borrado rápido»,[115]​ «Wikipedia no es una fuente primaria»,[116]​ «Verificabilidad»[117]​ y «Fuentes fiables».",Spanish
"[118]​ Según declaraciones oficiosas de un «bibliotecario» —administrador— colombiano de la Wikipedia en español, los «bibliotecarios» de esta Wikipedia eliminan más artículos que los de otras versiones de Wikipedia.",Spanish
[119]​ El contenido textual está bajo las licencias GNU y Creative Commons; la última versión se actualizó mediante una votación entre el 12 de abril y el 3 de mayo de 2009.,Spanish
"[120]​ Mediante el lema La enciclopedia libre se entendía, al modo del software libre, como un producto de distribución gratuita y sin restricciones.",Spanish
"Así también, se considera software por la codificación de MediaWiki, bajo GPL.",Spanish
"Esta redistribución presenta el requisito de que debe ser acreditada, es decir, debe mencionarse su atribución, ya que la licencia incluye Share-Alike; además, es necesario conservar esta licencia —u otra similar— evitando su protección de distribución.",Spanish
"[121]​ Sin embargo, se había estado trabajando en el cambio a licencias Creative Commons, porque la GFDL, inicialmente diseñada para manuales de software, no es adecuada para trabajos de referencia en línea y porque las dos licencias son incompatibles.",Spanish
"[122]​ A cada autor, editor o ilustrador que contribuye a la enciclopedia siempre se le atribuyen los derechos de autor según la convención de Berna.",Spanish
"[123]​ Un autor también puede copiar contenido de otro con el permiso correspondiente —sobre todo en el caso de contenido con licencia libre—, sin embargo no podrá usarse un contenido que prohíbe su distribución, reproducción o modificación de una manera ilícita, porque ello limitaría su utilización con seguridad y acarrearía problemas con las políticas.",Spanish
"Por ello, en la Wikipedia en inglés puede aparecer cualquier imagen ilustrativa siempre que lo haga de manera lícita.",Spanish
"[124]​ A excepción del contenido y varias de sus características, el isologo de esta marca corporativa está protegido, por lo que no se permite su distribución sin previa autorización.",Spanish
"[125]​ Para la fundación, la privacidad de la información es tan importante como la prevención de vandalismo.",Spanish
"[126]​ Muchos artículos son revertidos o incluso ocultados del historial —en la imagen—, este último se consigue con la eliminación de información a través de supresores que disponen de herramientas específicas para ello.",Spanish
"De este modo, por ejemplo, se eliminan las ediciones insultantes o intimidatorias y se evitan sobrecargas confusas en el historial del artículo.",Spanish
"[127]​ En cuanto a la comunidad, los usuarios no ceden demasiada información y es la propia comunidad quien decide salvar fácilmente de cualquier amenaza.",Spanish
[128]​ Ello permite atribuir de una manera «anónima» y minimiza el trabajo.,Spanish
"Para administrar, por ejemplo, se realizan estadísticas, para organizar las visitas, artículos, entre otros; pudiendo ser poco usual para censar comunidades.",Spanish
"En cuanto a la atribución, Creative Commons, por su parte, no garantiza el contenido por los derechos de imagen que hayan cedido.",Spanish
[129]​ En la Wikipedia en alemán los artículos no son publicados hasta haber sido revisados por un editor experto.,Spanish
Se está barajando la posibilidad de aplicar la misma medida en la Wikipedia en inglés.,Spanish
[130]​ Wikipedia está siendo editada por miles de personas en todo el mundo.,Spanish
"Con excepción de ciertas personas remuneradas por la Fundación Wikimedia,[131]​ el resto, conocidos en la jerga de Wikipedia como wikipedistas, actúan siempre de manera gratuita y voluntaria.",Spanish
"[132]​ En total, la comunidad está conformada por más de 400 millones de usuarios registrados en todo el mundo,[133]​ incluyendo algo más de 1 700 000 en la versión hispana, donde el 13 % son mujeres.",Spanish
"[134]​ En las páginas internas de Wikipedia —dirigidas fundamentalmente a los colaboradores—, se anima a los usuarios a participar activamente en el proyecto.",Spanish
"Hay diversas formas de colaborar: desde crear nuevos artículos, ampliar los ya existentes, o corregir textos que no cumplan las convenciones de estilo establecidas o cuya información sea errónea o inexacta, hasta clasificar artículos por materia, añadir imágenes y otros materiales multimedia del repositorio Commons, retirar textos con derechos de autor, aportar sugerencias, o, para los más inexpertos, señalar simplemente cualquier defecto encontrado con la finalidad de que otros lo corrijan.",Spanish
"Actualmente, 67 son administradores humanos y 31 son sistemas de mantenimiento robot como «trabajadores automáticos» de mantenimiento.",Spanish
Para colaborar no es necesario registrarse.,Spanish
"Por ese motivo, los contribuyentes que no se registran, conocidos como usuarios anónimos, aparecen identificados en sus ediciones con un número de IP en lugar de con un alias.",Spanish
"Por no estar registrados, tienen restringidas ciertas acciones, como la de votar en la toma de decisiones.",Spanish
En Wikipedia el registro es gratuito e instantáneo.,Spanish
"El usuario registrado, a diferencia del anónimo, se identifica con un alias y una página de usuario propia,[nota 8]​ además de poder personalizar su interfaz de edición wiki.",Spanish
Una condición necesaria a la hora de registrarse es elegir un alias que no resulte ofensivo o difícil de escribir.,Spanish
[135]​ A algunos usuarios que ya llevan un cierto tiempo editando en Wikipedia sin problemas se les asigna la categoría de autoconfirmados; sus ediciones aparecen en la página de cambios recientes con un fondo diferente al del resto de los usuarios.,Spanish
"Es una medida de economía de esfuerzos que permite que los usuarios que se dedican a combatir vandalismo y revertir ediciones incorrectas, basándose en la confianza en estos usuarios, se abstengan de comprobar sus ediciones y de este modo focalicen su labor en el resto de las ediciones, disminuyendo el volumen de trabajo con menor riesgo de equivocarse.",Spanish
"Al día de hoy, en la edición en español hay registrados 6 103 100 usuarios, de los cuales menos del 0,3 % son usuarios activos —usuarios que han realizado al menos una acción en los últimos 30 días—.",Spanish
"De acuerdo a Christian Stegbauer, un sociólogo alemán, «por el número de colaboradores no puede definirse si Wikipedia es democrática o no».",Spanish
"En sus propias palabras, y refiriéndose a la Wikipedia en alemán: «nuestra conclusión es que en el fondo son menos de 1000 personas las que deciden sobre esta enciclopedia digital».",Spanish
"[136]​ Se ha comprobado que determinados usuarios crean las llamadas cuentas de propósito particular; estos usuarios se registran con el único propósito de introducir información que beneficie sus propios intereses, motivo por el cual en numerosas ocasiones sus ediciones son sesgadas, parciales o inútiles desde el punto de vista enciclopédico.",Spanish
"[135]​ Según un análisis publicado el 1 de abril de 2009 por el investigador español José Felipe Ortega, del grupo Libresoft, de la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Wikipedia había sufrido «un descenso notable de editores» en todas sus versiones lingüísticas entre 2007 y 2009.",Spanish
La noticia fue ampliamente recogida por los medios de comunicación.,Spanish
"[137]​ Esta última afirmación fue desmentida por Jimmy Wales, fundador de Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[138]​ Una pequeña parte de los usuarios de Wikipedia —alrededor del 0,5 % de los usuarios activos y del 1,1 o/oooo del total de usuarios registrados en la Wikipedia en español—[139]​ se dedica a labores administrativas.",Spanish
"Estos usuarios ejercen esas funciones —tras ser propuestos por parte de otro u otros usuarios, generalmente veteranos— en una votación democrática abierta a la totalidad de la comunidad de usuarios registrados, y los requisitos y normas de dicha votación —y de cualquier votación en general— se recogen en una política llamada «Votaciones».",Spanish
"[140]​ Según el sociólogo alemán Christian Stegbauer, «[l]o interesante es que los administradores son elegidos, y así obtienen una especie de legitimidad democrática.",Spanish
"Por otro lado, solo una parte de las personas participa activamente en dicha elección, y muchos de ellos ya son administradores.",Spanish
"Si es un administrador el que propone a un candidato, la probabilidad de ser elegido es mayor que si la propuesta proviene de otro miembro».",Spanish
"[141]​ La Fundación Wikimedia describe los siguientes cargos administrativos principales, innecesarios para editar, pero sí necesarios para asuntos de protección y coordinación en el software:[142]​ Según declaraciones oficiosas de un bibliotecario colombiano de la Wikipedia en español, existe un problema de comunicación entre los bibliotecarios de esta Wikipedia en el ejercicio de las políticas y algunas personas que se consideran expertas en determinados temas, y este problema redunda en perjuicio para la enciclopedia.",Spanish
También afirma que los bibliotecarios de la Wikipedia en español eliminan más artículos que los de otras versiones de Wikipedia.,Spanish
"[143]​ En cualquier caso, las declaraciones de los usuarios de Wikipedia, ostenten cargo administrativo o no, deben tomarse como una mera opinión personal sin la menor representatividad, puesto que, si bien los bibliotecarios son elegidos democráticamente por el resto de los usuarios, entre sus funciones no se encuentran las de representar a la comunidad o a Wikipedia ni la de establecer autoridad más allá de la que les confiera el ejercicio de las políticas.",Spanish
[144]​ Regularmente operan en Wikipedia varios sistemas de edición automática.,Spanish
"Se denominan bots —contracción de robot—, y cumplen la realización de ciertas tareas tediosas para los editores, como la creación de enlaces entre las distintas ediciones de la enciclopedia, pequeños ajustes internos del código wiki, la corrección de faltas ortográficas, etc.",Spanish
"Algunas ediciones de Wikipedia utilizan también bots para la creación masiva de artículos, normalmente esbozos.",Spanish
"Para ser considerados como tales deben tener al menos el afijo BOT y un supervisor, el cual es el usuario propietario.",Spanish
[145]​ Wikipedia se ejecuta sobre el software libre MediaWiki.,Spanish
"MediaWiki es la fase III del programa, cuya historia de desarrollo es la siguiente: Se instalan varias extensiones de MediaWiki para ampliar la funcionalidad del software MediaWiki.",Spanish
"En julio de 2013, después de extensas pruebas beta, la extensión WYSIWYG del editor visual se abrió al uso público.",Spanish
[146]​[147]​[148]​[149]​ La característica se cambió a predeterminada después.,Spanish
Wikipedia actualmente se ejecuta en grupos dedicados de servidores Linux (principalmente Ubuntu).,Spanish
"[150]​[151]​ A diciembre de 2009, había 300 en Florida y 44 en Ámsterdam.",Spanish
"[152]​ Para el 22 de enero de 2013, Wikipedia había migrado su centro de datos primario a una instalación de Equinix en Ashburn, Virginia.",Spanish
"[153]​[154]​ En 2017, Wikipedia había instalado un clúster de almacenamiento en caché en una instalación de Equinix en Singapur, la primera de su tipo en Asia.",Spanish
"[155]​ Nota: No debe confundirse Wikipedia con la Fundación Wikimedia, la organización no gubernamental que mantiene al sitio web Wikipedia.",Spanish
"El sitio web de Wikipedia está mantenido exclusivamente por la Fundación Wikimedia, una organización sin ánimo de lucro instituida bajo las leyes de Florida (Estados Unidos) cuya finalidad es promover en el mundo apoyo económico y social para varios proyectos colaborativos de contenido libre.",Spanish
"[156]​[157]​ Su existencia fue oficialmente anunciada por el director general de Bomis y cofundador de Wikipedia, Jimbo Wales, el 20 de junio de 2003.",Spanish
"Dos de los proyectos de la Fundación Wikimedia actúan como complementos del resto de los proyectos, incluyendo a Wikipedia.",Spanish
"Uno es un almacén de contenido multimedia que los editores del resto de los proyectos pueden incrustar a modo de ilustraciones, y el otro se encarga del software que sustenta a todos los proyectos:[158]​ Hay contenidos que no tienen cabida en Wikipedia por no ser información enciclopédica.",Spanish
Por ello se han desarrollado varios proyectos hermanos independientes entre sí que recogen este otro tipo de información.,Spanish
Todos ellos son también multilingües y libres y están administrados por la Fundación Wikimedia.,Spanish
"[159]​ Wikipedia es uno de los sitios web más visitados y referenciados del mundo en Internet, y consecuentemente es uno de los primeros sitios —o incluso el primero, en muchos casos— de entre los que aparecen en los resultados de los motores de búsqueda.",Spanish
"[11]​[160]​ Este hecho, sumado a la influencia cada vez mayor de Internet sobre las personas, trae como consecuencia un enorme impacto popular de la enciclopedia colaborativa a todos los niveles, impacto que se va acrecentando a medida que pasa el tiempo.",Spanish
"[161]​[161]​ En los últimos años, Wikipedia ha estado influyendo notablemente en los medios de comunicación, sobre todo periodísticos, los cuales en numerosas ocasiones copiaron información de la web enciclopédica, la mayoría de las veces sin citar la fuente.",Spanish
"[162]​ A este respecto, es bastante ilustrativo el experimento realizado por Shane Fitzerald, un estudiante universitario dublinés de 22 años, publicado el 6 de mayo de 2009 por el periódico IrishTimes.com:[163]​[164]​ Tras enterarse del fallecimiento de Maurice Jarre unas horas antes, Shane editó el artículo correspondiente al compositor para incluir una cita ficticia: Poco después la cita apareció en las secciones necrológicas de los periódicos The Guardian y The London Independent, en el sitio web The BBC Music Magazine y en periódicos de la India y Australia.",Spanish
Este experimento demuestra la fuerza de Internet a escala global.,Spanish
"Los periodistas que usaron esta cita obviamente confiaron en Wikipedia como fuente de información; tal vez no podían permitirse el lujo de realizar investigaciones ulteriores bajo la presión de la necesidad de ser los primeros en publicar la cita, y como resultado proporcionaron a los lectores una información falsa.",Spanish
"En cuanto a Wikipedia, los errores normalmente se corrigen con prontitud, aunque, en casos como el relatado, no lo suficiente como para adelantarse a los acontecimientos.",Spanish
"Este tipo de experimentos raramente se realizan en Wikipedia, y los editores que son descubiertos reciben por parte de los administradores severos castigos que, en función de la gravedad de su falta, pueden llegar al bloqueo de su dirección IP a perpetuidad.",Spanish
"Por otra parte, existen personas que acusan a Wikipedia de difamación, y es ilustrativo el caso de Alejandro Peña Esclusa, quien afirmaba que el gobierno de su país estaba llevando contra él una campaña en la que colaboró la enciclopedia.",Spanish
"[165]​ En cualquier caso, Wikipedia, como proyecto de fuente no primaria que es, se basa en una serie de políticas que promueven la verificabilidad y el uso de fuentes fidedignas y reputadas.",Spanish
"A partir de este punto, Wikipedia delega cualquier tipo de responsabilidad en el momento en que publica el nombre de la fuente de la que se obtuvo la información.",Spanish
"De ahí, entre otras cosas, la importancia de la verificabilidad, uno de los cinco pilares básicos sobre los que se sustenta el proyecto.",Spanish
"[166]​ Se han producido varios casos en los que dirigentes políticos, o personas próximas a ellos, modificaron artículos de Wikipedia interesadamente.",Spanish
"[167]​[168]​ En otro orden de cosas, se han creado versiones que la parodian.",Spanish
"Entre las más conocidas se encuentran, en inglés, Uncyclopedia y Encyclopædia Dramatica, y, en español, La Frikipedia e Inciclopedia.",Spanish
"En historietas humorísticas, Skeletor aparece vandalizando el artículo de He-Man.",Spanish
"[169]​ Debido a sus méritos y popularidad, el sitio web ha obtenido a lo largo de los años varios galardones y menciones.",Spanish
[171]​ Algunas muestras son las siguientes: Los usuarios de Wikipedia organizan eventos regulares y ocasionales con el objetivo de promover la creación y edición de artículos.,Spanish
"Por ejemplo, en 2006 se creó un proyecto llamado Wiki-reto: 250 k, dedicado a aumentar el número de artículos, con el que se llegó al final del año a los 250 000 artículos en la Wikipedia en español.",Spanish
[184]​ Proyectos de ese tipo o similares se organizan cada año.,Spanish
"Por otro lado, existe una serie de proyectos incluidos en el propio sitio web que reciben el nombre de wikiproyectos, cada uno de los cuales se dedica a trabajar sobre un tema específico —correcciones ortográficas, creación y ampliación de artículos de determinado campo, manejo de ilustraciones, etc.",Spanish
"[185]​ Fuera del sitio web, otros han expresado las impresiones personales que el sitio les produce.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, Vicente Verdú, en un artículo de la versión digital del periódico El País, describió la experiencia de usar Wikipedia como «una divertida y multitudinaria manera de gozar, jugar, amar y pasar el rato».",Spanish
"[186]​ Por su parte, en un artículo de opinión en Terra Networks Perú se consideraba que su uso desordenado y excesivo causaba «wiki adicción».",Spanish
"[187]​ En una entrevista con Jimmy Wales, representante de la Fundación Wikimedia, para EFE, este explicó su creencia de que la expansión de Internet en otros países ampliaría el uso de Wikipedia sobre todo en lugares subdesarrollados, creando de este modo una conexión de culturas.",Spanish
"[188]​ Con motivo del décimo aniversario de Wikipedia, el mismo Wales declaró su deseo de que Wikipedia alcanzase los 1000 millones de usuarios para 2015.",Spanish
"[189]​ En el ámbito económico, Alex Konanykhin, fundador y presidente de WikiExperts.us —no perteneciente a Wikimedia—, presentó a Wales una propuesta de colaboración.",Spanish
El plan consistía en ofrecer los servicios de una red de escritores por contrato a todas las empresas o entidades que cumpliesen con los requisitos de rigor exigidos por Wikipedia para crearles sus propios artículos de forma enciclopédica.,Spanish
"Según Konanykhin, este modelo financiero aseguraría el futuro de Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[190]​ No obstante, Wikipedia, lejos de presentar apuros económicos, ha batido su récord de recaudación en la campaña efectuada para el ejercicio de 2011, con 16 millones de dólares procedentes de 500 000 donantes de 140 países, todo ello en tan solo un mes y medio.",Spanish
"[191]​ La crítica a Wikipedia ha sido dirigida hacia su contenido, sus procedimientos, el carácter y las prácticas de la comunidad de Wikipedia, así como su naturaleza como enciclopedia de fuentes abiertas que cualquiera puede editar.",Spanish
"Las principales preocupaciones de sus críticos son la fiabilidad del contenido, la escritura de su prosa, la organización de los artículos, así como la existencia de sesgos sistémicos, de género y raciales entre la comunidad editorial.",Spanish
"Wikipedia también ha sido criticada por su manejo desigual, aceptación y retención de artículos en temas polémicos.",Spanish
Hay controversia sobre su fiabilidad y precisión.,Spanish
[193]​ La revista científica Nature declaró en diciembre de 2005 que la Wikipedia en inglés era casi tan exacta en artículos científicos como la Encyclopaedia Britannica.,Spanish
[194]​ El estudio se realizó comparando 42 artículos de ambas obras por un comité de expertos sin que estos supieran de cuál de las dos enciclopedias provenían.,Spanish
"El resultado fue que Wikipedia tenía casi el mismo nivel de precisión que la Enciclopedia Británica, pero tenía un promedio de un error más por artículo.",Spanish
"[195]​ Por otro lado, y según consta en un reportaje publicado en junio de 2009 por el periódico español El País, un estudio de 2007, dirigido por el periodista francés Pierre Assouline y realizado por un grupo de alumnos del máster de Periodismo del Instituto de Estudios Políticos de París para analizar la fiabilidad del proyecto, se materializó en el libro La revolución Wikipedia (Alianza Editorial) cuyas conclusiones eran bastante críticas.",Spanish
"Entre otras cosas, afirmaba que el estudio de Nature fue poco estricto y sesgado, así como que, según su propio estudio, la Britannica continuaba siendo un 24 % más fiable que la Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[196]​ Desde su nacimiento, Larry Sanger ya discrepó por la posible falta de veracidad, y le siguieron después otros autores, caso de Arias Maldonado (2010, p. 15-31) o Assouline et al.",Spanish
(2008).,Spanish
"Incluso los que la defienden como una obra documentada, caso de Tim O'Reilly, la colocan en los últimos puestos.",Spanish
"[197]​ Ndesanjo Macha indica que muchas veces lo más enriquecedor está en las discusiones y no en el artículo propiamente dicho, porque allí pueden reflejarse mejor los distintos puntos de vista y las lagunas existentes.",Spanish
"Para Bob McHenry, exeditor de la Enciclopedia Británica, uno de los mayores riesgos a los que se enfrenta Wikipedia es la entrada de personas convencidas de que su punto de vista es el verdadero, impidiendo incluir cualquier otro.",Spanish
"Por esta razón, lo realmente valioso puede aparecer en las discusiones y no el artículo, como confirma Ndesanjo Macha.",Spanish
[197]​ Para Assouline et al.,Spanish
"(2008, p. 12) Wikipedia está matando los valores de verificación y consulta de fuentes primarias que deben tener los periodistas, historiadores o profesionales del conocimiento en general.",Spanish
"Según el autor ""esta enciclopedia en línea es también el instrumento ideal para desinformar"" al ser editada por partidos políticos y otros grupos de presión.",Spanish
"[198]​ Además presenta problemas en la diferenciación de lo importante y lo superfluo: así, en la versión francesa, la entrada sobre Albert Londres comenzaba diciendo «periodista judío francés [...]» como si su religión fuese el segundo dato más importante del resumen, incierto al mismo tiempo por ser londinense y católico, fruto de una campaña para desacreditarlo haciéndolo pasar por judío.",Spanish
"Otro ejemplo era el artículo sobre Alexandre Solzhenitsyn que dedicaba la mitad de su contenido a la relación del escritor con España, por haber realizado un comentario sobre Francisco Franco que no gustó al redactor.",Spanish
"[199]​ Los ejemplos dados por Assouline sobre la excesiva extensión de unos contenidos frente a otros fueron refrendados por un estudio dirigido por la Universidad de Minnesota, junto a otras tres, en 2011.",Spanish
"La conclusión fue que la Wikipedia en inglés mostraba que los artículos realizados por mujeres, presumiblemente destinados más a un público femenino, eran significativamente más cortos que los redactados por hombres o por hombres y mujeres.",Spanish
"En ese mismo año la Universidad de Oxford demostró que el 84 % de las referencias a localidades se situaban en Europa y América del Norte, del mismo modo que la Antártida contaba con más artículos que África o Sudamérica.",Spanish
"[200]​ Dos de los principales motivos por los cuales Wikipedia es criticada en cuanto a la exactitud y fiabilidad de sus contenidos son la persistencia de detalles erróneos difíciles de detectar —imprecisiones no necesariamente malintencionadas, pero que pueden permanecer en un artículo por mucho tiempo—.",Spanish
"[201]​ Por su parte los actos vandálicos, modificaciones inapropiadas u ofensivas de los artículos que entorpecen el desarrollo del proyecto, constituyen un importante factor en las problemáticas de contenido, cuya solución a largo plazo no pasa —como sucede en los otros dos casos— por una mejora constante de la calidad ni por la incorporación o ampliación progresiva de artículos.",Spanish
"Mientras que las inexactitudes de contenido y las tendencias de crecimiento irregular[200]​ pueden ser subsanadas a medida que siga evolucionando el proyecto —y aumenten las ediciones de artículos—, el vandalismo representa una amenaza constante que se incrementa en proporción al crecimiento exponencial de Wikipedia.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, la exposición a una mayor afluencia de visitas a los artículos publicados en varios medios de prensa implicaba un porcentaje muy alto de vandalismos —incluidos de personajes públicos—, casi tanto como el de cambios constructivos.",Spanish
"[202]​[203]​[204]​ Pero no solo se trata de ediciones dentro de artículo, también existen artículos enteros falsos.",Spanish
"[nota 10]​ La Wikipedia en inglés posee una entrada dedicada solo a ellos, como también la Wikipedia en español.",Spanish
La existencia de artículos falsos con una duración de casi diez años siembra dudas sobre la capacidad de Wikipedia para autocorregirse.,Spanish
"En otros casos, además de la duración destaca los sucesivos filtros por los que pasaron, caso del Conflicto de Bicholim que fue redactado sin que nadie se percatara del fraude, propuesto a Bueno, elegido como Artículo Bueno, propuesto a Destacado y rechazado por cuestiones técnicas sin que nadie comprobase la veracidad de los contenidos.",Spanish
"[205]​ De manera similar pasó con el artículo Cayo Flavio Antonino, supuesto asesino de Julio César, cuya entrada permaneció ocho años en forma de esbozo.",Spanish
"[206]​ Uno de los más controversiales fue Santiago Swallow, conferencista ficticio creado por Kevin Ashton y que fue descubierto al publicarse un artículo de prensa donde el autor declaró que «invirtió 68 dólares para hacerlo famoso».",Spanish
"[207]​[208]​ En 2014 se desarrolló un algoritmo hecho por la Universidad de Nankín de Correos y Telecomunicaciones sobre la base de la red bayesiana, método similar a la detección de correo basura; se piensa que el sistema se implementará en un futuro próximo.",Spanish
"[209]​ Un ejemplo paradigmático de vandalismo masivo se produjo el 31 de julio de 2006 como consecuencia de una llamada a la participación por parte de Stephen Colbert, un conocido humorista y presentador de la televisión norteamericana, en una sección de su programa The Colbert Report que tituló Wikiality:[211]​ Después de algunos gags en torno a la posibilidad de cambiar la ubicación de estados y países en sus respectivas definiciones de Wikipedia, animó a los telespectadores a modificar la entrada 'elefante' para que constara que, en lugar de disminuir, la población del elefante africano se había triplicado.",Spanish
"Como resultado inmediato, hasta veinte entradas de la Wikipedia en inglés que hacían referencia a elefantes fueron bloqueadas por sus administradores, o bien pasaron a estado de semi-protegidas, solo modificables por usuarios registrados con un mínimo de antigüedad.",Spanish
"Para todos los ejemplos citados y sus variantes, aparte de las medidas correctoras llevadas a cabo en forma de reversión, aviso o bloqueo, la comunidad de wikipedistas crea y mantiene —al igual que sucede entre programadores voluntarios en entornos de software libre— toda una serie de herramientas e implementaciones técnicas destinadas a actuar contra el vandalismo, desde foros y canales específicos de IRC hasta programas paralelos de detección y aviso, pasando por usuarios que son en realidad programas bot cuya misión es exclusivamente combatir los actos vandálicos.",Spanish
"Parece que con dichas modificaciones ese problema comenzó a estar bajo control desde 2007, pero limitó las posibilidades de supervivencia de Wikipedia.",Spanish
[200]​ En otras ocasiones los errores llegan por la confusión.,Spanish
"Algunos han confundido «Wikipedia» con «WikiLeaks»,[212]​ un sitio de almacenamiento de documentos filtrados conocido por la polémica del cablegate.",Spanish
"Jimmy Wales, cofundador de Wikipedia, explicó que, cuando en 2006 WikiLeaks comenzó sus actividades, se presentó como la 'Wikipedia de los secretos'.",Spanish
Cuando Wales fundó Wikipedia creó una organización llamada Wikia.,Spanish
"Esta organización se encargó de registrar los dominios bajo el término Wiki, y permitió a WikiLeaks en sus comienzos la utilización del término Wiki y su dominio correspondiente.",Spanish
"No obstante, actualmente —enero de 2011—, los dominios adquiridos por WikiLeaks están a punto de caducar, y Jimmy Wales no tiene intención de renovar el contrato ya que, en sus propias palabras, no desea que Wikipedia se relacione con WikiLeaks.",Spanish
"[213]​ El proyecto cuenta con importantes subvenciones de multinacionales estadounidenses, de intereses capitalistas.",Spanish
"[214]​[215]​ Por otro lado, en opinión de César Rendueles, doctor en filosofía, profesor asociado de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid[216]​ y usuario de Wikipedia, «todo [en Wikipedia] es mucho más doméstico de lo que alguna gente se imagina».",Spanish
"En su opinión, «la enciclopedia está “controlada” por todos aquellos que generosamente dedican su tiempo regularmente a la edición de artículos», y afirma que como resultado la enciclopedia refleja el perfil predominantemente conservador —aunque en muchos casos para la redacción de artículos, muestra el lado liberal, dando mayor énfasis en la libertad de contenido que en la cooperación del mismo—[217]​[218]​ de quienes disponen de más tiempo libre.",Spanish
Concluye diciendo que «una mayor presencia de la comunidad universitaria y escolar sería un auténtico soplo de aire fresco» para la enciclopedia.,Spanish
"[219]​ Opinión contraria a otros autores como Daniel Rodríguez Herrera, para quien la Wikipedia posee una clara tendencia izquierdista, lo cual se comprueba viendo los resúmenes de Stalin y otros dirigentes comunistas que no son llamados en ningún momento ""dictadores"", solamente líderes.",Spanish
[220]​ Algunas empresas han intentado en repetidas ocasiones manipular la información que aparece sobre ellas en Wikipedia enfatizando los aspectos positivos y suavizando o eliminando los negativos con el fin de mejorar su imagen corporativa.,Spanish
"Por ejemplo, Microsoft eliminó un párrafo donde aparecían los errores de su consola Xbox 360, y el consorcio petrolífero Chevron-Texaco borró todo un texto sobre biodiésel.",Spanish
En 2013 el diario económico Expansión denunció las acciones de algunas de las principales empresas españolas para manipular su historial o alterar favorablemente las biografías de sus directivos.,Spanish
[221]​ Cambios de este tipo pueden ser detectados con la utilización de una herramienta llamada WikiScanner.,Spanish
"[222]​ Otras críticas, además de en su precisión, han estado refiriéndose a la violación de la intimidad de algunas personas,[223]​[224]​ a la adición de imágenes interpretadas como pornografía infantil,[225]​[226]​ la escasa certeza en las entradas sobre temas de salud,[227]​ o a la creación de artículos biográficos sobre animales.",Spanish
Algunas denuncias llegaron a ser muy notorias y graves como el uso del escudo perteneciente a la Oficina Federal de Investigación en uno de sus artículos.,Spanish
"[228]​ Un tema de controversia en ciertos medios es la labor de algunos administradores —«bibliotecarios»—, que se extralimitan en sus funciones bloqueando a otros usuarios y generando enfados, razón por la cual varios quieren mantener su incógnito por miedo a represalias.",Spanish
"[199]​ También el ambiente de Wikipedia permite e incluso fomenta ese tipo de actuaciones; pues, según Arias Maldonado,[229]​ una de las partes divertidas de Wikipedia es conspirar.",Spanish
"Una evidencia por parte de FiveThirtyEight sobre los 100 artículos más editados de la versión en inglés muestra que los temas más controvertidos para la Wikipedia son los deportes, personajes del entretenimiento norteamericano, política y religión.",Spanish
"En el top de la lista están los artículos sobre Estados Unidos, Michael Jackson, Jesucristo y los luchadores de la WWE, el último mucho mayor que el artículo del Real Madrid.",Spanish
[230]​ Un estudio sobre el tratamiento desigual en los contenidos de la mayor enciclopedia de la web dio cuenta de que solo las grandes mujeres están bien representadas en la enciclopedia y los artículos sobre ellas presentan desigualdades de género.,Spanish
"[236]​[237]​ A pesar de que cada vez más personas  se informan en Wikipedia, este sitio web ha visto una baja significativa en sus visitas en el buscador Google, unos 250 millones en tres meses (abril-junio de 2015) que representa  cerca del 11 %, así lo informó un estudio de Similar Web, empresa británica de tecnología e información y luego corroborado por el  cofundador de Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales.",Spanish
"[239]​ Una de las razones  de esa brusca caída puede ser que el buscador da una referencia directa a Wikipedia al lado derecho de la pantalla, lo que quitaría la necesidad de cliquear el enlace.",Spanish
"[240]​ En un informe de Hackernoon, sitio web estadunidense en publicación de tecnología, Wikipedia había perdido en 2019 +3k millones de páginas vistas.",Spanish
"En enero de 2020, había perdido un 14% de su tráfico en comparación con el mismo mes de 2019.",Spanish
"El principal culpable de esta bajada es el buscador de Google, que entre sus muchas funciones y herramientas, muestra a menudo extractos de Wikipedia cuando se hace una búsqueda y suele dar prioridad a los vídeos de YouTube, plataforma de su propiedad.",Spanish
[241]​ Similar situación está ocurriendo debido a los asistentes de Alexa y Siri.,Spanish
[242]​ Este sistema de búsquedas tan de moda se llama búsqueda sin 'clicks y hace que Wikipedia pierda visitas a gran velocidad.,Spanish
"Según Ortega Soto (2009) las principales versiones de Wikipedia (inglesa, alemana, japonesa, española, etc) estaban perdiendo usuarios porque los nuevos editores no compensaban en número a los veteranos que abandonaban la edición.",Spanish
Además había disminuido el tiempo medio que un editor tardaba en desistir.,Spanish
"[243]​ Esta tendencia la confirmó en 2013 Tom Simonite, del Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts (MIT), cuando confirmaba que la propia Fundación Wikimedia reconocía que la enciclopedia en línea tenía problemas ante la carencia cada vez más acusada de voluntarios.",Spanish
"[200]​ En contraste, el análisis de tendencias publicado en The Economist presenta a Wikipedia en otros idiomas (Wikipedia no inglesa) como exitosa en retener a sus editores activos de manera renovable y sostenida, con un número relativamente constante.",Spanish
"[244]​ En 2010, Alison J.",Spanish
Head y Michael B. Eisenberg publicaron una investigación sobre el uso que dan a la Wikipedia los estudiantes universitarios.,Spanish
"El estudio tuvo lugar en siete universidades de Estados Unidos, y tenía como objetivo mostrar con qué frecuencia, motivos y en qué momento de un trabajo académico, se utiliza esta enciclopedia.",Spanish
El resultado la posicionó como la sexta fuente de consulta y la segunda no académica; la enciclopedia predilecta para obtener un trasfondo general sobre un tema.,Spanish
"Se ubicó por delante de sitios gubernamentales, compañeros de clase, colecciones personales de libros, y la Enciclopedia Británica, que quedó relegada al undécimo puesto (61 %).",Spanish
"[245]​[246]​ Un estudio de la Universidad Carolina de 2018 concluyó que Wikipedia es el recursos educativo abierto más utilizado por estudiantes, y argumentó que las instituciones educativas deberían centrar su atención en ello (por ejemplo, apoyando wikipedistas residentes).",Spanish
"[247]​ El aprendizaje automático o aprendizaje automatizado o aprendizaje de máquinas (del inglés, machine learning) es el subcampo de las ciencias de la computación y una rama de  la inteligencia artificial, cuyo objetivo es desarrollar técnicas que permitan que las computadoras aprendan.",Spanish
"Se dice que un agente aprende cuando su desempeño mejora con la experiencia; es decir, cuando la habilidad no estaba presente en su genotipo o rasgos de nacimiento.",Spanish
"[1]​ De forma más concreta, los investigadores del aprendizaje de máquinas buscan algoritmos y heurísticas para convertir muestras de datos en programas de computadora, sin tener que escribir los últimos explícitamente.",Spanish
Los modelos o programas resultantes deben ser capaces de generalizar comportamientos e inferencias para un conjunto más amplio (potencialmente infinito) de datos.,Spanish
"En muchas ocasiones el campo de actuación del aprendizaje automático se solapa con el de la estadística inferencial, ya que las dos disciplinas se basan en el análisis de datos.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, el aprendizaje automático incorpora las preocupaciones de la complejidad computacional de los problemas[2]​.",Spanish
"Muchos problemas son de clase NP-hard, por lo que gran parte de la investigación realizada en aprendizaje automático está enfocada al diseño de soluciones factibles a esos problemas.",Spanish
El aprendizaje automático también está estrechamente relacionado con el reconocimiento de patrones.,Spanish
El aprendizaje automático puede ser visto como un intento de automatizar algunas partes del método científico mediante métodos matemáticos.,Spanish
Por lo tanto es un proceso de inducción del conocimiento.,Spanish
"El aprendizaje automático tiene una amplia gama de aplicaciones, incluyendo motores de búsqueda, diagnósticos médicos, detección de fraude en el uso de tarjetas de crédito, análisis del mercado de valores, clasificación de secuencias de ADN, reconocimiento del habla y del lenguaje escrito, juegos y robótica.",Spanish
"Algunos sistemas de aprendizaje automático intentan eliminar toda necesidad de intuición o conocimiento experto de los procesos de análisis de datos, mientras otros tratan de establecer un marco de colaboración entre el experto y la computadora.",Spanish
"De todas formas, la intuición humana no puede ser reemplazada en su totalidad, ya que el diseñador del sistema ha de especificar la forma de representación de los datos y los métodos de manipulación y caracterización de los mismos.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, las computadoras son utilizadas por todo el mundo con fines tecnológicos muy buenos.",Spanish
El aprendizaje automático tiene como resultado un modelo para resolver una tarea dada.,Spanish
Entre los modelos se distinguen[3]​ Los modelos pueden también clasificarse como modelos de agrupamiento y modelos de gradiente.,Spanish
Los primeros tratan de dividir el espacio de instancias en grupos.,Spanish
"Los segundos, como su nombre lo indican, representan un gradiente en el que se puede diferenciar entre cada instancia.",Spanish
Clasificadores geométricos como las máquinas de vectores de apoyo son modelos de gradientes.,Spanish
Los diferentes algoritmos de Aprendizaje Automático se agrupan en una taxonomía en función de la salida de los mismos.,Spanish
Algunos tipos de algoritmos son: El análisis computacional y de rendimiento de los algoritmos de aprendizaje automático es una rama de la estadística conocida como teoría computacional del aprendizaje.,Spanish
El aprendizaje automático las personas lo llevamos a cabo de manera automática ya que es un proceso tan sencillo para nosotros que ni nos damos cuenta de cómo se realiza y todo lo que implica.,Spanish
"Desde que nacemos hasta que morimos los seres humanos llevamos a cabo diferentes procesos, entre ellos encontramos el de aprendizaje por medio del cual adquirimos conocimientos, desarrollamos habilidades para analizar y evaluar a través de métodos y técnicas así como también por medio de la experiencia propia.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, a las máquinas hay que indicarles cómo aprender, ya que si no se logra que una máquina sea capaz de desarrollar sus habilidades, el proceso de aprendizaje no se estará llevando a cabo, sino que solo será una secuencia repetitiva.",Spanish
Este tipo de aprendizaje usa un árbol de decisiones como modelo predictivo.,Spanish
Se mapean observaciones sobre un objeto con conclusiones sobre el valor final de dicho objeto.,Spanish
Los árboles son estructuras básicas en la informática.,Spanish
Los árboles de atributos son la base de las decisiones.,Spanish
"Una de las dos formas principales de árboles de decisiones es la desarrollada por Quinlan de medir la impureza de la entropía en cada rama, algo que primero desarrolló en el algoritmo ID3 y luego en el C4.5.",Spanish
"Otra de las estrategias se basa en el índice GINI y fue desarrollada por Breiman, Friedman et alia.",Spanish
El algoritmo de CART es una implementación de esta estrategia.,Spanish
[5]​ Los algoritmos de reglas de asociación procuran descubrir relaciones interesantes entre variables.,Spanish
"Entre los métodos más conocidos se hallan el algoritmo a priori, el algoritmo Eclat y el algoritmo de Patrón Frecuente.",Spanish
Los algoritmos genéticos son procesos de búsqueda heurística que simulan la selección natural.,Spanish
Usan métodos tales como la mutación y el cruzamiento para generar nuevas clases que puedan ofrecer una buena solución a un problema dado.,Spanish
Las redes de neuronas artificiales (RNA) son un paradigma de aprendizaje automático inspirado en las neuronas de los sistemas nerviosos de los animales.,Spanish
Se trata de un sistema de enlaces de neuronas que colaboran entre sí para producir un estímulo de salida.,Spanish
Las conexiones tienen pesos numéricos que se adaptan según la experiencia.,Spanish
"De esta manera, las redes neurales se adaptan a un impulso y son capaces de aprender.",Spanish
"La importancia de las redes neurales cayó durante un tiempo con el desarrollo de los vectores de soporte y clasificadores lineales, pero volvió a surgir a finales de la década de 2000 con la llegada del aprendizaje profundo.",Spanish
Las MVS son una serie de métodos de aprendizaje supervisado usados para clasificación y regresión.,Spanish
Los algoritmos de MVS usan un conjunto de ejemplos de entrenamiento clasificado en dos categorías para construir un modelo que prediga si un nuevo ejemplo pertenece a una u otra de dichas categorías.,Spanish
El análisis por agrupamiento (clustering en inglés) es la clasificación de observaciones en subgrupos —clusters— para que las observaciones en cada grupo se asemejen entre sí según ciertos criterios.,Spanish
Las técnicas de agrupamiento hacen inferencias diferentes sobre la estructura de los datos; se guían usualmente por una medida de similitud específica y por un nivel de compactamiento interno (similitud entre los miembros de un grupo) y la separación entre los diferentes grupos.,Spanish
El agrupamiento es un método de aprendizaje no supervisado y es una técnica muy popular de análisis estadístico de datos.,Spanish
"Una red bayesiana, red de creencia o modelo acíclico dirigido es un modelo probabilístico que representa una serie de variables de azar y sus independencias condicionales a través de un grafo acíclico dirigido.",Spanish
"Una red bayesiana puede representar, por ejemplo, las relaciones probabilísticas entre enfermedades y síntomas.",Spanish
"Dados ciertos síntomas, la red puede usarse para calcular las probabilidades de que ciertas enfermedades estén presentes en un organismo.",Spanish
Hay algoritmos eficientes que infieren y aprenden usando este tipo de representación.,Spanish
"En el aprendizaje automático podemos obtener 3 tipos de conocimiento, que son: Los tres tipos se efectúan durante un proceso de aprendizaje automático pero la importancia de cada tipo de conocimiento depende de las características de lo que se está tratando de aprender.",Spanish
"El aprendizaje es más que una necesidad, es un factor primordial para satisfacer las necesidades de la inteligencia artificial.",Spanish
El aprendizaje supervisado se caracteriza por contar con información que especifica qué conjuntos de datos son satisfactorios para el objetivo del aprendizaje.,Spanish
"Un ejemplo podría ser un software que reconoce si una imagen dada es o no la imagen de un rostro: para el aprendizaje del programa tendríamos que proporcionarle diferentes imágenes, especificando en el proceso si se trata o no de rostros.",Spanish
"En el aprendizaje no supervisado, en cambio, el programa no cuenta con datos que definan qué información es satisfactoria o no.",Spanish
"El objetivo principal de estos programas suele ser encontrar patrones que permitan separar y clasificar los datos en diferentes grupos, en función de sus atributos.",Spanish
"Siguiendo el ejemplo anterior un software de aprendizaje no supervisado no sería capaz de decirnos si una imagen dada es un rostro o no pero sí podría, por ejemplo, clasificar las imágenes entre aquellas que contienen rostros humanos, de animales, o las que no contienen.",Spanish
La información obtenida por un algoritmo de aprendizaje no supervisado debe ser posteriormente interpretada por una persona para darle utilidad.,Spanish
A continuación se muestran una serie de temas que podrían formar parte del temario de un curso sobre aprendizaje automático.,Spanish
El aprendizaje automático nació de la búsqueda de inteligencia artificial.,Spanish
"Ya en los primeros días de la IA como disciplina académica, algunos investigadores se interesaron en hacer que las máquinas aprendiesen.",Spanish
"Trataron de resolver el problema con diversos métodos simbólicos, así como lo que ellos llamaron 'redes neurales' que eran en general perceptrones y otros modelos básicamente basados en modelos lineares generalizados como se conocen en las estadísticas.",Spanish
Muchos lenguajes de programación pueden usarse para implementar algoritmos de aprendizaje automático.,Spanish
Los más populares para 2015 eran R y Python.,Spanish
"[6]​ R es muy usado ante todo en el campo académico, mientras que Python es más popular en la empresa privada.",Spanish
"Entre los paquetes de software que incluyen algoritmos de aprendizaje automatizado, se hallan los siguientes:  Los algoritmos de aprendizaje automático a menudo pueden verse afectados por el sesgo que puedan tener los datos (Ver sesgo algoritmico).",Spanish
Por ejemplo no se podrán clasificar todos aquellas entradas de las que no se haya recibido ninguna información en la fase de entrenamiento.,Spanish
De hecho cuando el entrenamiento se realiza con datos clasificados por el ser humano el aprendizaje automático tiende a crear los mismos segos que hay en la sociedad.,Spanish
"Algunos ejemplos de esto son cuando en 2015 el algoritmo de Google photos identificaba algunas personas negras con gorilas, o en 2016 cuando el bot de Twitter de Microsoft desarrollo comportamientos racistas y machistas a base de observar el tráfico de datos en dicha red social.",Spanish
"Por este motivo en los últimos años ha habido una tendencia a desarrollar métodos para aumentar la equidad, es decir, para reducir el sesgo en este tipo algoritmos por parte de los expertos en IA.",Spanish
"Citando a Fei-fei Li ""La IA no tiene nada de especial.",Spanish
"Se inspira en personas, es creada por personas, y lo más importante impacta en las personas.",Spanish
"Es una herramienta muy poderosa que tan solo hemos comenzado a entender, y esa es una gran responsabilidad"" [7]​ 
.todos estamos buscando formas rápidas de ser más fluidos en inglés sé que entiendo que lo que pasa es que hay solo unas pocas palabras dando vueltas en nuestro cerebro y necesitamos hacer toda esta conversación usando simplemente increíble, increíble, genial o épico aprenda algunas palabras en inglés nuevas e inteligentes que puede usar en su vida diaria y mejore su vocabulario en minutos.",Spanish
"así que hoy vamos a aprender 10 nuevas palabras inteligentes con sus significados, palabras raíz y oraciones de ejemplo, así que vamos a empezar.",Spanish
"Hola a todos, esto es y están viendo.",Spanish
y en este video les daré 10 palabras inteligentes para el uso diario y al final de este video.,Spanish
También voy a darte un consejo inteligente para que suene realmente fluido.,Spanish
"uno está inundado inundado significa ahogamiento o inundación, pero inundado se usa a menudo en el contexto del trabajo como yo ' Estoy abrumado por el trabajo Tengo demasiado trabajo por hacer He estado abrumado por el trabajo esta semana entera Apenas he tenido tiempo para respirar ahora veamos la raíz de esta palabra.",Spanish
"pantano es un pedazo de pantano y si alguien pisa un pantano en el lugar equivocado, podría ahogarse fácilmente y la forma verbal de pantano significa hundirse, así que así es como puedes usar esta palabra.",Spanish
digamos que tienes muchas asignaciones y tienes una prueba próxima y tus amigos vienen a ti y te dicen.,Spanish
"Oye, ¿por qué no pasas el rato con nosotros?",Spanish
Puedes decirles que lo siento mucho pero estoy abrumado por el trabajo o estoy abrumado por algunas otras palabras que puedes usar en lugar de abrumado ¿tengo demasiado?,Spanish
que hacer.,Spanish
"hay demasiado en mi plato, me estoy ahogando en el trabajo.",Spanish
"Estoy inundado de asignaciones, la palabra inteligente número dos es catch-22 ahora estoy seguro de que tú ' He escuchado esta palabra antes de catch-22 significa una situación imposible en la que no puedes hacer una cosa a menos que hayas hecho la otra y no puedas hacer la otra porque no has hecho lo primero.",Spanish
"Te confundí, así que déjame darte algunos ejemplos.",Spanish
Una situación sin sentido es cuando no consigues un trabajo sin tener experiencia laboral.,Spanish
pero no se puede adquirir experiencia hasta que consigues un trabajo.,Spanish

κούκλα και το πιο διασκεδαστικό είναι ότι αγαπούσε τον εαυτό της χωρίς ναρκίσσα θα θέλατε.,Greek
"βοήθησέ με να ψήσω το ψωμί, έτσι κι αλλιώς μαμά το αλεύρι υπηρέτησε όλα τα φωτεινά και φωτεινά μάτια μου narcisa θα με βοηθούσες να φυτέψω αυτούς τους σπόρους, γιατί γιατί θα έκανα αυτό που έχω όλη αυτή τη βρωμιά στα υπέροχα δάχτυλά μου χειρότερα, αν πήγε καλά στο πρόσωπό μου, αυτό ήταν το πρόβλημα με τη ναρκίσσα.",Greek
"πίστευε ότι ήταν πολύ μεγάλη για να κάνει οποιαδήποτε δουλειά, πολλοί μνηστήρες ήρθαν να ζητήσουν να πάρουν ναρκίσσους.",Greek
"δεδομένου ότι η ομορφιά της ήταν γνωστή πολύ μακριά, αλλά τους απέρριψε όλα πολύ αγενή γιατί έστειλε εκείνους τους άντρες χθες φαινόταν ωραία δεν μπορείς να είσαι σοβαρή μαμά, ένας από αυτούς.",Greek
είχα τόσο μικρά μάτια σχεδόν σαν πουλί και το άλλο είχε μια τεράστια μύτη που δεν θα ήθελα να είμαι κοντά του.,Greek
"όταν φταρνίστηκε ω και η τελευταία στάση όχι δεν θέλω να ακούσω πια το μόνο που μπορούσα να δω ήταν ότι αυτοί οι άντρες ήταν πολύ καλοί, αγαπητέ μου, πρέπει να ξέρετε αυτή την ομορφιά.",Greek

Ξύπνησα ότι ήταν όλα χαμόγελα και γέλια εδώ γλυκιά μου να μου πει τι ονειρευόσασταν.,Greek

"και είπε ότι ήθελε να με παντρευτεί, είχε έρθει σε μια χρυσή άμαξα και ήταν ντυμένος από πάνω προς τα κάτω και χρυσός, επίσης, τι ανόητο όνειρο.",Greek
και ξέρεις ότι το καλύτερο ήταν όταν ήμουν στο νυφικό μου που ήταν από χρυσό και φυσικά όλοι με κοίταζαν μόνο ναρκίσσα δεν υπάρχει τίποτα καταπληκτικό για αυτό το όνειρο.,Greek
ήταν μια πολύ εγωιστική ονειρεμένη μαμά που δεν ξέρεις τι λες ότι το όνειρο με έκανε να συνειδητοποιήσω ότι χρειάζομαι φαγητό πολύ μεγαλύτερο από τον τύπο που τρώω εδώ στο σπίτι ψωμί από χρυσό.,Greek
απλά σκεφτείτε ότι η φτωχή μητέρα του ναρκίσσου ανησυχούσε τόσο πολύ για την κόρη της και πώς.,Greek
"θα ζούσε τη ζωή της εκείνη την ημέρα δύο φίλοι ήρθαν να επισκεφτούν τη μητέρα του ναρκίσσου που ήταν mellie και ο Terry οι τρεις τους ήταν φίλοι για αιώνες, αλλά η Terry και η Έλλη είχαν ένα μυστικό και οι δύο.",Greek
"ήταν μαγικά όντα κάτι που η μητέρα της ναρκίσσας δεν γνώριζε τίποτα για τον Terry Melli, είναι τόσο καλό να σε βλέπω που ήταν πολύ καιρό πώς είσαι, ήμουν πολύ καλός, θα ήμουν καλύτερα αν μόνο αν και μόνο αν η κόρη μου η ναρκίσσα ήταν λίγο πιο κατανοητή, η μαριάν είπε στην Mellie και τον Terry τα πάντα για τη ναρκίσσα και πώς ανησυχούσε γι 'αυτήν που θέλει να φάει ψωμί από χρυσό τι να κάνω μαζί της, ίσως αν το όνειρό της γίνει πραγματικότητα.",Greek
"αυτό θα ήταν υπέροχο, δεν θα είχε σημασία αν υποθέτω ότι θα μεγαλώσει για να μάθει ας μιλήσουμε για κάτι άλλο.",Greek
"τώρα αργότερα η Μέλι και ο Τέρι έσπασαν αντίο στον παλιό τους φίλο και πήγαν να χαμογελούν ο ένας στον άλλο κρυφά εκείνο το βράδυ, τόσο μητέρα όσο και κόρη.",Greek
"ετοιμάστηκα για το κρεβάτι της μητέρας, πραγματικά ελπίζω να γίνει πραγματικότητα το όνειρό μου, ξέρετε ω ναρκίσσα την επόμενη μέρα, καθώς η ναρκίσσα και η μητέρα της ήταν έξω στον κήπο τους μια όμορφη.",Greek
"Χρυσή άμαξα ήρθε πάνω τους, ήταν γεμάτη με πολύτιμους λίθους και διαμάντια και φαινόταν εξαιρετικά εκπληκτική.",Greek
"καθώς σταμάτησε ένας όμορφος άντρας βγήκε από αυτό και κοίταξε τη νάρκισσα, ήταν εντελώς ξαφνιασμένος με το πόσο όμορφος ήταν το όνειρό μου, στην πραγματικότητα γίνεται πραγματικότητα.",Greek
"τι γεια σας ήρθα εδώ για να ζητήσω να νάρκισσος παραδώσει το γάμο, αλλά πώς ξέρετε το όνομά της και ποιος είστε.",Greek
"Είμαι ο άγγελος της καλής τύχης, το όνομα και η ομορφιά της κόρης σας είναι γνωστό σε όλο τον κόσμο εδώ, σας έφερα ένα δώρο, αλλά σχεδόν δεν τον γνωρίζετε ότι δεν μπορείτε να πάτε μαζί του.",Greek
"ω, ανόητος είναι πλούσιος και όμορφος, τι περισσότερο θα ήθελα να έχω έδαφος, αποδέχομαι την πρότασή σας.",Greek
"και με αυτό μπήκε στο καροτσάκι του και χωρίς καν να αποχαιρετήσει τη μητέρα της, έφυγε με τον άγγελο καθώς ταξίδευαν το άμαξα ξαφνικά μπήκε σε μια μαγική πύλη εκεί που ταξίδεψε μέσα από μια θυελλώδη περιοχή, η άμαξα έπεσε τρομερά και ναρκίσσα.",Greek

"από ένα τεράστιο και υπέροχο χρυσό κάστρο Νάρκισα ήταν έκπληκτος με όλη την ομορφιά που είδε, ήξερα ότι αξίζω τόσα πολλά πλούτη, ήξερα ότι θα θέλατε ό, τι θέλετε θα βρείτε εδώ από τα πιο όμορφα φορέματα έως τα πιο νόστιμα φαγητά όλα αυτά στο παλάτι μου μιλώντας καλά για φαγητό είμαι πολύ πεινασμένος μετά από αυτήν τη βόλτα Πεινασμένος μπορώ να έχω κάποιο από αυτά τα νόστιμα φαγητά, φυσικά εδώ κρέας μυρωδιά μέλισσα που θα σας πάρει ό, τι θέλετε, σας έχω ακούσει τόσα πολλά για εσάς, φτωχοί αγαπητοί, πεινάτε, δεν έρχεστε, πάμε στο τραπέζι θα σου φέρω λίγο φαγητό, ευχαριστώ που πήγαν στην τραπεζαρία και εκεί στο τραπέζι ήταν το πιο εκπληκτικό φαγητό που είχε δει η νάρκισα ποτέ καταπληκτική, διότι είναι φτιαγμένες οι μαρμελάδες.",Greek
από ρουμπίνια οι σαλάτες από σμαράγδια και το ψωμί εκεί είναι φτιαγμένο από χρυσό χρυσό ψωμί πόσο υπέροχη θα φαίνεται αυτή η μαρμελάδα και θα έχει υπέροχη γεύση με το ψωμί που πήρε μια φέτα με το.,Greek
"ρουμπίνι μαρμελάδα σε αυτό και πήρε ένα τεράστιο δάγκωμα αυτό είναι τόσο ζεστό δεν μπορώ να το φάω καλά, είναι ψωμί από χρυσό και το καλύτερο, αλλά αν δεν μπορείτε να το φάτε θα σας πάρω ασημένιο ψωμί ασημί, γιατί να μην το κάνετε τρως.",Greek
"κάτι άλλο, αλλά θέλω κανονικό ψωμί ψωμί το οποίο μπορώ να φάω, δεν έχεις αυτή την εμφάνιση, έτσι η σύζυγος του κοχύλι μου είναι κρύο, πρέπει να φάτε μόνο τα καλύτερα ναρκίσια που κοίταξα όλα τα φαγητά.",Greek
"αλλά ήταν σπασμένη για ό, τι ήταν βρώσιμο, σύντομα άρχισε να κλαίει δεν το θέλω αυτό, αλλά το φαγητό είναι πολύ καλό.",Greek

ω μαμά σ 'αγαπώ τόσο πολύ και είσαι σωστή εμφάνιση και ο πλούτος δεν είναι όλα όσα το χρυσό ψωμί ήταν άχρηστο καθώς δεν μπορούσα να το φάω και ο άντρας.,Greek
"ήταν όμορφος, δεν με νοιάζει καθόλου, αλλά αγαπητή μου, συνειδητοποιείς ότι είναι ακριβώς ο τρόπος με τον οποίο φέρεσαι στους άλλους, ξέρω ότι λυπάμαι πολύ για τον τρόπο με τον οποίο ενήργησα η μαμά, όχι, είναι εντάξει από τότε που είδατε.",Greek
"τι ήρθε το λάθος σου, ας σου δώσουμε κάτι ωραίο από εκείνη τη μέρα και μετά.",Greek

"πως' Ο ναρκισσισμός, τώρα η Μαρία, τους είπε όλα όσα είχαν συμβεί και έχει αλλάξει τόσο πολύ από τότε.",Greek
"Μήπως υποθέτω ότι δεν θα ήθελε άλλο χρυσό ψωμί τώρα, έτσι ξέρεις.",Greek

В 2009 году вошёл в Список 100 самых влиятельных журналов биологии и медицины за последние 100 лет под № 1 и был назван Журналом Столетия.,Russian
Однако критерии отбора статей в Nature (как и в Science) чрезвычайно жёстки.,Russian
"Большинство направляемых в Nature статей отсеиваются ещё до стадии рецензирования, поскольку результаты исследований, описанные в предлагаемой к публикации статье, должны представлять существенное продвижение в той или иной области науки.",Russian
"Так, именно в Nature были опубликованы статьи: В 2009 году 3 из 5 самых цитируемых в мире статей по биологии были напечатаны в журнале Nature[7].",Russian
"Нобелевский лауреат по медицине 2013 года Рэнди Шекман при вручении ему премии заявил, что ведущие научные журналы, среди которых и Nature, мешают научному процессу, так как желание увидеть свою публикацию в ведущих журналах побуждает учёных «срезать углы» и заниматься тем, что считается модным, а не тем, что важнее для науки.",Russian
"Кроме того, по мнению Шекмана, проблема в том, что редакторы этих журналов являются не учёными, а издателями и их интересуют прежде всего шумиха, сенсация и фурор.",Russian
"Он пообещал больше не отправлять свои статьи в журналы Nature, Cell и Science.",Russian
"[8] Академик РАН Е. Д. Свердлов, кроме случая с Шекманом, также обращает внимание на инцидент с японскими учёными из Центра биологии развития Института физико-химических исследований (RIKEN), опубликовавшими в 2014 году в журнале две статьи с изложением итогов опытов над зрелыми клетками мышей, подвергавшихся различному роду стрессовых воздействий, включая погружение в кислоту — метод, получивший известность под названием «получение плюрипотентности, вызванной стимулом (англ.",Russian
)русск.» (англ.,Russian
"stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency, STAP), в ходе которых ими был обнаружен новейший способ преобразования клеток в эмбрионально-подобное (плюрипотентное) состояние.",Russian
"Данное исследование первоначально было высоко оценено мировым научным сообществом, поскольку являлось теоретическим и медицинским открытием и позволяло упростить получение стволовых клеток необходимых для пересадки.",Russian
"Однако в дальнейшем в ходе внутреннего расследования RIKEN было обнаружено, что Харуко Обоката, являвшаяся ключевым лицом в группе исследователей, совершила крупный подлог с фотографиями и рисунками.",Russian
"Следствием этого стал отзыв публикаций и самоубийство научного руководителя исследования Ёсики Сасаи, решившегося на это чтобы сохранить лицо.",Russian
"[9] В 2018 году группа исследователей из США, Швеции, Новой Зеландии, Сингапура, Германии, Нидерландов и Китая под руководством психолога Б. Нозека (англ.)",Russian
"повторила эксперименты по общественным наукам, результаты которых были опубликованы в журналах Science и Nature в 2010—2015 годах, и выяснила, что из 21 эксперимента только 13 (62 %) прошли проверку на воспроизводимость[10][11].",Russian
Википе́дия (англ.,Russian
"Wikipedia, произносится [ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdiə] или [ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə]) — общедоступная многоязычная универсальная интернет-энциклопедия со свободным контентом[комм.",Russian
"2], реализованная на принципах вики.",Russian
Расположена по адресу wikipedia.org.,Russian
"Владелец сайта — американская некоммерческая организация «Фонд Викимедиа», имеющая 37 региональных представительств.",Russian
"Название энциклопедии образовано от английских слов wiki («вики»; в свою очередь заимствовано из гавайского языка, в котором оно имеет значение «быстро») и encyclopedia («энциклопедия»).",Russian
"Запущенная в январе 2001 года Джимми Уэйлсом и Ларри Сэнгером[7], Википедия сейчас является самым крупным и наиболее популярным[8] справочником в Интернете[9][10][11].",Russian
По объёму сведений и тематическому охвату Википедия считается самой полной энциклопедией из когда-либо создававшихся за всю историю человечества[12][13].,Russian
Одним из основных достоинств Википедии как универсальной энциклопедии является возможность представления информации на родном языке пользователя[14].,Russian
"На май 2018 года разделы Википедии есть на 301 языке, а также на 493 языках в инкубаторе.",Russian
Она содержит более 40 миллионов[1] статей.,Russian
Интернет-сайт Википедии является пятым по посещаемости сайтом в мире[15].,Russian
"Главной особенностью Википедии является то, что создавать и редактировать статьи в ней может любой пользователь Интернета[комм.",Russian
3].,Russian
Все вносимые такими добровольцами изменения незамедлительно становятся доступными для просмотра всем посетителям сайта.,Russian
"В декабре 2013 года в заявлении ЮНЕСКО по случаю награждения Джимми Уэйлса, основателя Википедии, Золотой медалью Нильса Бора про Википедию было сказано, что она является «символом эпохи взаимодействия, в которую мы живём, и это не просто инструмент, это воплощение мечты, столь же древней, как человеческий интеллект и собрания Александрийской библиотеки»[16][17].",Russian
Надёжность и точность Википедии вызывают вопросы[18].,Russian
Википедию критикуют за возможность добавления ложной или непроверенной информации[19] и вандализма на её страницах.,Russian
"Однако научные исследования свидетельствуют о том, что в Википедии следы актов вандализма обычно оперативно устраняются[20][21].",Russian
Раздел Википедии на русском языке на 28 июня 2020 года занимает 7-е место по количеству статей среди всех языковых разделов.,Russian
"В отличие от традиционных энциклопедий, таких, как Encyclopædia Britannica, ни одна статья в Википедии не проходит формального процесса экспертной оценки.",Russian
"Любая статья Википедии может редактироваться как с учётной записи участника, так даже и без регистрации на проекте (за исключением некоторых страниц, подверженных частому вандализму, которые доступны для изменения только определённым категориям участников или, в крайних случаях, только администраторам Википедии), и при этом все внесённые в статью изменения незамедлительно становятся доступными для просмотра любыми пользователями.",Russian
"Поэтому Википедия «не гарантирует истинность» своего содержимого[22], ведь в любом случае между моментом, когда в статью будет внесена какая-то недостоверная информация, и моментом, когда эта информация будет удалена из статьи другим участником Википедии (более компетентным в данной области знания), пройдёт определённое время.",Russian
"(Естественно, для того, чтобы обнаружить и удалить из статьи явный вандализм, нужно намного меньше времени, чем для того, чтобы освободить статью от недостоверной информации, когда подобная недостоверность не является особо очевидной.)",Russian
"Содержимое Википедии подпадает под действие законов (в частности, авторского права) штата Вирджиния в США, где находятся серверы Википедии, и нескольких редакционных политик и руководств, которые призваны укрепить идею о том, что Википедия является энциклопедией.",Russian
"Каждый вклад в Википедию должен быть по теме, являющейся энциклопедической.",Russian
"Тема считается энциклопедической, если она является «значимой»[23] на жаргоне Википедии, то есть если она получила значительное освещение во вторичных авторитетных источниках (например в центральных СМИ или серьёзных научных журналах), которые являются независимыми от предмета темы.",Russian
"В Википедии должна отражаться информация, которая уже установлена и признана[24].",Russian
"Иными словами, статья не должна быть «площадкой» для размещения чьих бы то ни было собственных идей, теорий, исследований, изобретений, личных мнений, оценок чего бы то ни было, искусствоведческой критики и т. п. Информация в статьях, которая, скорее всего, будет поставлена под сомнение, требует ссылок на авторитетные источники.",Russian
"Сообщество Википедии сформулировало это как «проверяемость, а не истина», выражая тем самым ту мысль, что читателям предоставляется возможность самим проверить истинность той информации, которая представлена в статьях, и сделать свои собственные выводы[25].",Russian
Википедия не становится на чью-либо сторону[26].,Russian
"В рамках статьи Википедии все мнения и точки зрения должны иметь соответствующую долю освещения по данному вопросу, если они имеют свои подтверждения во внешних источниках[27].",Russian
"Все участники, зарегистрированы они на проекте или нет, могут пользоваться функциями программного обеспечения, на котором работает Википедия.",Russian
"Так, на странице «История», прилагающейся к каждой статье Википедии, доступны записи каждой предыдущей редакции статьи (версии с угрозами криминального характера, нарушениями авторских прав и т. п. могут быть скрыты от просмотра[комм.",Russian
4]).,Russian
"Эта функция позволяет легко сравнить нынешнюю и более старые версии статьи, отменить изменения («откатить статью»), которые участник посчитает неверными, или восстановить потерянное содержимое.",Russian
"Страница «Обсуждение», прилагающаяся к каждой статье Википедии, используется в целях координации работы над текстом этой статьи между разными участниками проекта[28].",Russian
"Постоянные участники нередко используют «Список наблюдения», в который заносят интересные для себя статьи и, таким образом, могут легко отслеживать все недавние изменения в этих статьях.",Russian
"Компьютерные программы, называемые ботами, в Википедии широко используются для удаления вандализма, как только он был произведён[21], а также для исправления общих ошибок и стилистических проблем или создания статей, например, о географических объектах или биологических видах в стандартном формате из статистических данных.",Russian
"Википедия началась как дополнительный проект для «Нупедии» — бесплатного англоязычного энциклопедического онлайн-проекта, чьи статьи были написаны специалистами и рецензированы в рамках формального процесса.",Russian
"«Нупедия» была основана 9 марта 2000 года как собственность Bomis, Inc. — компании, владеющей одноимённым веб-порталом.",Russian
"Ключевыми фигурами были Джимми Уэйлс, CEO Bomis и Ларри Сэнгер, главный редактор «Нупедии», а затем Википедии.",Russian
"«Нупедия», первоначально лицензированная в соответствии со своей лицензией Nupedia Open Content License, перешла на GNU Free Documentation License перед основанием Википедии по настоянию Ричарда Столлмана[29].",Russian
Основатели Википедии — Ларри Сэнгер и Джимми Уэйлс[30][31].,Russian
"В то время как Уэйлсу приписывается определение цели создания публично редактируемой энциклопедии[32][33], Сэнгеру обычно приписывают контринтуитивную стратегию использования вики для достижения этой цели[34].",Russian
"10 января 2001 года Ларри Сэнгер в списке рассылки «Нупедии» предложил применить концепцию «вики» в отношении «Нупедии»[35], чтобы ускорить её развитие.",Russian
"Это привело к созданию веб-сайта Википедии, которая изначально задумывалась для предварительной разработки материалов, которые потом были бы размещены в «Нупедии».",Russian
Название «Википедия» также было предложено Ларри Сэнгером[31].,Russian
Википедия была официально открыта 15 января 2001 года как одиночный англоязычный раздел на www.wikipedia.com[36] и была анонсирована Сэнгером в списке рассылки «Нупедии»[32].,Russian
Политика «нейтральной точки зрения» в Википедии[37] была введена в первые месяцы и была аналогична ранней политике «непредубеждения» в «Нупедии».,Russian
"В других отношениях, первоначально существовало относительно немного правил, и Википедия управлялась независимо от «Нупедии»[32].",Russian
"Википедия получила ранних участников из «Нупедии», сообщений на Slashdot и за счёт индексации поисковыми машинами.",Russian
Она выросла до примерно 20 000 статей и 18 языковых разделов к концу 2001 года.,Russian
"К концу 2002 года она достигла 26 языковых разделов, 46 к концу 2003 года и 161 к последним дням 2004 года[38].",Russian
"«Нупедия» и Википедия сосуществовали, пока серверы первой не были навсегда отключены в 2003 году (текст «Нупедии» был включён в Википедию).",Russian
"Английская Википедия прошла отметку в 2 млн статей 9 сентября 2007 года, что делает её крупнейшей энциклопедией, собравшей всё и затмившей даже энциклопедию Юнлэ (1407), которая держала рекорд ровно 600 лет[39].",Russian
"Ссылаясь на опасения по поводу коммерческой рекламы и отсутствие контроля в осознанном англоцентризме Википедии, пользователи испанской Википедии выделились из Википедии для создания Enciclopedia Libre в феврале 2002 года[40].",Russian
"Позднее в том же году Уэйлс объявил о том, что Википедия не будет отображать рекламу, и её веб-сайт был перемещён на wikipedia.org[41].",Russian
Некоторые другие проекты выделились из Википедии по редакционным причинам.,Russian
Wikinfo не требует нейтральной точки зрения и разрешает оригинальные исследования.,Russian
"Новые проекты, вдохновлённые Википедией, — такие, как Citizendium, Scholarpedia, Conservapedia и Google Knol[42], — были начаты в ответ на осознание ограничений Википедии, таких, как политика в области рецензирования, оригинальных исследований и коммерческой рекламы.",Russian
Фонд Викимедиа (англ.,Russian
Wikimedia Foundation) был создан из Википедии и «Нупедии» 20 июня 2003 года[43].,Russian
Он использовался в United States Patent and Trademark Office для регистрации товарного знака «Wikipedia» 17 сентября 2004 года.,Russian
10 января 2006 года знаку был предоставлен зарегистрированный статус.,Russian
"16 декабря 2004 года товарный знак получил защиту со стороны Японии, 20 января 2005 года — в Европейском союзе.",Russian
"Существуют планы лицензирования торговой марки Википедии для некоторых продуктов, таких, как книги и DVD[44].",Russian
В ноябре 2015 года Википедия получила Премию Эразма[45].,Russian
Пользователи Википедии — это: Участники Википедии образуют сообщество участников Википедии.,Russian
"Структура этого сообщества — иерархическая, то есть это своего рода структура власти[46][47].",Russian
"Участники Википедии с хорошей репутацией в сообществе могут баллотироваться на один из многих уровней добровольного руководства; это начинается с «администратора»[48], самой большой группы привилегированных пользователей (1594 учётных записей в английской Википедии, по состоянию на 30 сентября 2008 года), которые имеют возможность удаления страниц, блокировки статей от изменений в случае вандализма или редакторских споров и блокировки участников.",Russian
"Несмотря на название, администраторы не имеют никаких особенных привилегий в процессе принятия решений, и им запрещено использовать свои полномочия для урегулирования споров.",Russian
"Роли администраторов часто описываются как «уборка» и в основном ограничиваются внесением правок, имеющих эффект в масштабах всего проекта (и поэтому запрещённых для обычных редакторов, чтобы минимизировать нарушения), а также блокировкой пользователей для предотвращения разрушительных правок, таких как вандализм.",Russian
"Поскольку Википедия развивается на основе нетрадиционной модели составления энциклопедии, вопрос «Кто пишет „Википедию“?» стал одним из наиболее часто задаваемых вопросов по проекту, часто со ссылкой на другие проекты Веб 2.0, такие как Digg[49] или, например, News2 и Хабрахабр.",Russian
"Джимми Уэйлс однажды утверждал, что только «сообщество… преданная группа нескольких сотен добровольцев» делает основной вклад в Википедию и что этот проект является поэтому «очень похожим на любую традиционную организацию».",Russian
"Это было позже оспорено Аароном Шварцем, который отметил, что ряд просмотренных им статей имели крупные части содержания, внесёнными участниками с малым количеством правок[50].",Russian
"Исследование учёных из Дартмутского колледжа, проведённое в 2007 году, установило, что анонимы и те пользователи, которые редко делают вклад в Википедию, являются таким же надёжным источником знаний, как и те, которые зарегистрированы на сайте[51].",Russian
"Хотя некоторые участники сильны в своей области, Википедия требует, чтобы даже их вклады были подкреплены опубликованными и поддающимися проверке источниками.",Russian
Это предпочтение консенсуса наличию образования было отмечено как «антиэлитарность»[52].,Russian
"В августе 2007 года сайт, разработанный аспирантом по компьютерным наукам Вирджилом Гриффитом и названный WikiScanner, начал публичное функционирование.",Russian
"WikiScanner прослеживает источники миллионов изменений, произведённых в Википедии анонимными редакторами, и показывает, что многие из этих правок делаются из корпораций или правительственных учреждений в статьях, связанных с ними, их персоналом или их работой, из которых они пытаются удалить критику[53].",Russian
"В 2003 году в исследовании о Википедии как о сообществе студент  Andrea Ciffolilli утверждал, что низкие операционные затраты участия в вики создают катализатор для совместного развития и что подход «творческого развития» поощряет участие[54].",Russian
"В своей книге «Будущее Интернета и как его остановить» 2008 года Jonathan Zittrain из Оксфордского института Интернета и Berkman Center for Internet & Society Гарвардской школы права ссылается на Википедию как социологическое исследование в том, как открытое сотрудничество способствовало инноваторству в Сети[55].",Russian
"В 2007 году исследователь Одед Нов опубликовал работу о мотивации, которой руководствуются википедисты.",Russian
"Нов считает, что участники редактируют Википедию, исходя из следующих видов мотивации: защитной («когда я правлю „Википедию“, я чувствую себя не так одиноко»), желание внести вклад в общее дело («мне кажется, важно помогать другим»), мотивации карьеры («я могу получить новые контакты, которые могут помочь в моём бизнесе или карьере»), социальной, познавательной («написание „Википедии“ позволяет мне взглянуть на вещи по-новому»), желание быть кому-то нужным («когда я правлю „Википедию“, я чувствую себя востребованным»), потребность в положительных эмоциях («писать/править „Википедию“ — это весело»), идеологической[56].",Russian
"На 30 июня 2015 года существует 290 языковых разделов Википедии, из них 51 раздел содержит более 100 000 статей, а 237 — более 1000 статей[57].",Russian
Посещаемость разделов изменяется со временем.,Russian
К октябрю 2009 года русская Википедия вышла на 5-ю позицию в списке посещаемости.,Russian
По состоянию на август 2013 года русская Википедия находилась на 4-м месте.,Russian
"Первые 5 разделов в это время имели следующий процент посещений, от общего числа: английская — 60,7 %; испанская — 7,8 %; немецкая — 6,7 %; русская — 6,0 %; японская — 5,8 %[58].",Russian
"Википедия является сетевой энциклопедией, поэтому участники одного и того же языкового раздела могут использовать различные диалекты и могут быть из разных стран (как в случае с английским разделом).",Russian
Эти различия могут привести к некоторым конфликтам из-за различного написания слов (например color vs. colour)[59] или точек зрения[60].,Russian
"Несмотря на то, что различные языковые разделы придерживаются глобальной политики, такой как нейтральная точка зрения, они расходятся по некоторым вопросам политики и практики, особенно по вопросу, могут ли изображения, которые не лицензируются по свободной лицензии, использоваться согласно требованиям добросовестного использования[61][62][63].",Russian
Джимми Уэйлс описал Википедию как «усилия по созданию и распространению свободной энциклопедии самого высокого качества для каждого человека на планете на его собственном языке»[64].,Russian
"Несмотря на то, что функционирование каждого языкового раздела более или менее самостоятельно, предприняты некоторые усилия для контроля всех разделов.",Russian
"Они координируются частично Мета-вики, вики Фонда Викимедиа, посвящённой поддержанию всех его проектов (Википедия и др.).",Russian
"Например, Мета-вики предоставляет важную статистику всех языковых разделов Википедии и поддерживает список статей, которые должны быть во всех Википедиях.",Russian
"Список касается основного содержания таких предметов, как биография, история, география, общество, культура, наука, технология, продовольствие и математика.",Russian
"Что касается остального, то нередко для статей, тесно связанных с конкретным языком, нет копии в другом разделе.",Russian
"Например, статьи о малых городах США могут быть доступны только на английском.",Russian
"Переводные статьи представляют лишь небольшую долю статей в большинстве разделов, в частности потому, что автоматизированный перевод статей не разрешён[65].",Russian
"Статьи, доступные более чем на одном языке, могут иметь «интервики»-ссылки, которые связывают статьи с их копиями в других разделах.",Russian
Википедия не лишена недостатков.,Russian
"Прежде всего информация, тексты Википедии объективно подвержены системным отклонениям.",Russian
"Другими основными объектами критики Википедии являются: Критики Википедии указывают на то, что участники Википедии совместно пишут и пересматривают её правила, политики и руководства[67], а затем, зачастую чисто формально и очень негибко их придерживаясь, удаляют, аннотируя тегами комментариев, или изменяют материалы статей, формально не отвечающие этим правилам, политикам и руководствам (см.",Russian
также Википедия:Удализм и Википедия:Инклюзионизм[68][69]).,Russian
"Сообщество Википедии было также описано как «подобное культу»[70], хотя и не всегда с исключительно негативной коннотацией[71] и было раскритиковано за неспособность привлечь неопытных пользователей к работе в проекте[72].",Russian
"Также критики Википедии обращают внимание на системную предвзятость, несбалансированность в освещении тем[52], а также критикуют её политику предпочтения консенсуса между участниками профессионализму отдельных участников в редакционном процессе[73].",Russian
Открытый характер модели редактирования является центральным для большой части критики Википедии.,Russian
"Например, исходя из этого, можно упрекать Википедию в том, что читатель статьи не может быть уверен без ознакомления со страницей её «истории», была ли эта статья вандализирована.",Russian
"Критики утверждают, что редактирование статей неэкспертами подрывает качество представленного в статье материала.",Russian
"Поскольку участники обычно, как правило, переписывают или редактируют отдельные небольшие части статьи, а не всю её целиком, высоко- и низкокачественные материалы могут идти вперемешку в пределах одной статьи.",Russian
"Историк Рой Розенцвейг отметил: «В целом, написание является „ахиллесовой пятой“ Википедии.",Russian
"Комитеты редко пишут хорошо, и статьи Википедии часто имеют изменчивое качество, что является результатом связывания вместе предложений или абзацев, написанных разными людьми»[74].",Russian
Всё это привело к вопросу о надёжности Википедии в качестве источника достоверной информации.,Russian
"Модель Википедии позволяет редактировать её статьи всем желающим и полагается на большую группу благонамеренных редакторов в преодолении проблем, вызванных сомнительными редакторами.",Russian
"Она основана и на принципе, согласно которому подавляющее большинство участников Википедии предполагает добрые намерения.",Russian
Модели редактирования Википедии свойственна возможность добавления низкокачественной информации.,Russian
"Возможность анонимного редактирования может быть не только большим благом для проекта, но и источником некоторого вреда.",Russian
Википедия может подвергаться воздействию вандалов.,Russian
"Вандализм в Википедии — явно вредительское добавление, удаление или изменение содержания, совершённое умышленно в целях скомпрометировать достоверность и авторитетность энциклопедии.",Russian
"В основном вандализм проявляется в замене содержимого статей Википедии на ругательства, граффити, заведомо ложные данные или другое содержимое, абсолютно не имеющее отношения к теме статьи.",Russian
В случаях множественного вандализма к некоторым страницам Википедии может быть применена защита.,Russian
"Являясь общедоступным интернет-справочником, Википедия также содержит материалы, которые другие участники Википедии могут признать нежелательными, оскорбительными или порнографическими[75][76].",Russian
"Например, в 2008 году Википедия отклонила массовое онлайн-обращение против включения изображения Мухаммеда в её английский раздел, сославшись на свою редакционную политику.",Russian
"Наличие в Википедии материалов, «неудобных» с политической точки зрения, также побудило КНР заблокировать доступ к части Википедии для китайских пользователей[77] (см.",Russian
также Блокирование Википедии британской организацией Internet Watch Foundation).,Russian
"Один из основателей Википедии Ларри Сэнгер, который является и одним из её самых жёстких критиков, в 2015 году заявил, что для него Википедия стала разочарованием, поскольку она была захвачена троллями и участниками, чей антиэлитаризм поставил крест на достоверности статей.",Russian
"По словам Сэнгера, Википедия напоминает «психбольницу, управление которой осуществляют сумасшедшие»[31].",Russian
В 2017 году директор некоммерческого партнёрства «Викимедиа.ру» Владимир Медейко объявил о готовности русскоязычной версии «Википедии» к сотрудничеству с обществом «Знание» в деле верификации статей.,Russian
"По его словам, возможны два варианта подобного взаимодействия: использование экспертами «Знания» функции «сообщить об ошибке» с последующим написанием там своих комментариев, которые будут проверены участниками «Википедии», либо создание специального проекта по взаимодействию «Википедии» и «Знания»[78].",Russian
"Техническое функционирование Википедии обеспечивает «Фонд Викимедиа» — некоммерческая организация, которая также поддерживает работу ряда других вики-проектов и осуществляет их финансирование.",Russian
"Фонд также владеет торговой маркой «Wikipedia», но в содержание энциклопедии и в деятельность добровольцев практически никак не вмешивается.",Russian
"Фонд, поддерживаемые им проекты и глобальное сообщество добровольных редакторов образуют Движение Викимедиа.",Russian
В разных странах созданы региональные организации (т. н.,Russian
"«Отделения Викимедиа») и местные ассоциации википедистов, которые также участвуют в продвижении, развитии и финансировании проекта.",Russian
"Функционирование Википедии зависит от MediaWiki — программного механизма для веб-сайтов, работающих по технологии «вики».",Russian
"MediaWiki написан на PHP и для хранения данных использует реляционную базу данных (можно использовать MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) и поддерживает использование программ memcached и Squid[79].",Russian
"MediaWiki предоставляет интерфейс для работы с базой страниц, разграничение прав доступа к администрированию системы, возможность обработки текста как в собственном формате, так и в форматах HTML и TeX (для формул), возможность загрузки изображений и других файлов, а также другие возможности.",Russian
Гибкая система расширений позволяет пользователям добавлять собственные новые возможности и программные интерфейсы.,Russian
"MediaWiki лицензирован под GNU General Public License и используется всеми проектами Викимедиа, а также многими другими вики-проектами.",Russian
"Первоначально Википедия работала на UseModWiki, написанном на Perl Клиффордом Адамсом («Фаза I»), который первоначально требовал CamelCase для указания ссылок на статьи; используемый сейчас стиль двойных скобок был включён позже.",Russian
С января 2002 года («Фаза II») Википедия начала работать на PHP-викидвижке с базой данных MySQL; это ПО было сделано на заказ для Википедии Магнусом Манске.,Russian
ПО «Фазы II» было неоднократно модифицировано с учётом экспоненциально растущего спроса.,Russian
"В июле 2002 года («Фаза III») Википедия перешла на третье поколение программного обеспечения, движок MediaWiki, первоначально написанный Даниэлем Ли Крокером.",Russian
"Википедия в настоящее время работает на выделенных кластерах серверов Linux (в основном Ubuntu[80][81]), с несколькими машинами OpenSolaris для ZFS.",Russian
"Вики-проекты Фонда Викимедиа, самым крупным из которых является Википедия, по состоянию на март 2013 года поддерживались работой нескольких кластеров, состоящих из 974 серверов[82].",Russian
"Википедия работала на одном сервере до 2004 года, когда настройка сервера была расширена в распределённую многоуровневую архитектуру.",Russian
"В январе 2005 года проект работал на 39 выделенных серверах, расположенных в штате Флорида.",Russian
"Эта конфигурация включала в себя один главный сервер баз данных с запущенным MySQL, несколько подчинённых серверов баз данных, 21 веб-сервер с запущенным Apache HTTP Server и 7 серверов кэша Squid.",Russian
"Википедия получает от 25 000 до 60 000 запросов страниц в секунду, в зависимости от времени суток[83].",Russian
Запрос страницы сначала передаётся внешнему уровню кэширующих серверов Squid[84].,Russian
"Запросы, которые не могут быть обслужены кэшем Squid, направляются на балансирующие нагрузку сервера с запущенным ПО Linux Virtual Server, который, в свою очередь, передаёт запрос на один из веб-серверов Apache для рендеринга (перевода в HTML) страниц из базы данных.",Russian
"Веб-сервера доставляют страницы по запросу, выполняя рендеринг страницы для всех языковых разделов Википедии.",Russian
"Для увеличения скорости в дальнейшем, переведённые в HTML страницы некоторое время хранятся в распределённом кэше в памяти.",Russian
Это позволяет пропустить процесс рендеринга страницы для наиболее часто запрашиваемых статей.,Russian

"Часть текстов доступна только под лицензией CC-BY-SA, о чём должна иметься пометка в самой статье, на её странице обсуждения или в истории правок[86].",Russian
"Положение о том, что Википедия — это просто услуга размещения этих текстов, было успешно использовано в качестве защиты в суде[87][88].",Russian
"Изначально использовалась только лицензия GFDL, однако позднее был осуществлён переход на лицензию CC-BY-SA, так как GFDL, первоначально предназначенная для руководств к программному обеспечению, сложно использовать для онлайн-справочников[89].",Russian
"3 ноября 2008 года в ответ на просьбу Фонда Викимедиа Free Software Foundation (FSF) выпустила новую версию FDL, разработанную специально для того, чтобы позволить Википедии перелицензировать её материалы под CC-BY-SA до 1 августа 2009 года.",Russian
"Википедия и её братские проекты провели широкий референдум в сообществе относительно того, стоит ли перейти на другую лицензию[90][91].",Russian
В результате переход был осуществлён.,Russian
Обработка мультимедийных файлов (например файлов изображений) различна в разных языковых версиях.,Russian
"Некоторые языковые разделы (например английская Википедия) включают несвободные файлы в соответствии с доктриной добросовестного использования, в то время как другие предпочли не делать этого.",Russian
"Это происходит отчасти из-за разницы в законах об авторском праве в разных странах, например, понятие добросовестного использования не существует в японском авторском праве.",Russian

Несколько языковых версий опубликовали подборку статей Википедии в версии на оптических дисках.,Russian
"Английская версия, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, содержала около 2000 статей.",Russian
"Ещё одна английская версия[92], разработанная Linterweb, содержит «1988+ статей»[93][94].",Russian
Польская версия содержит около 240 000 статей[95].,Russian
Существует также несколько немецких версий[96].,Russian
Первое издание немецкой Википедии было выпущено на CD в декабре 2004 года и стоило 3 €[97].,Russian
Было разослано около 40 000 дисков.,Russian
"Второе издание вышло в апреле 2005 года как на CD, так и на DVD.",Russian
"Диск содержал 205 000 статей и 10 000 изображений, находящихся в общественном достоянии.",Russian
"Directmedia продала 30 000 дисков по 9,90 € каждый.",Russian
В декабре того же года появилось третье издание.,Russian
"В него вошли DVD (300 000 статей и 100 000 изображений) и книга объёмом 139 страниц, в которой рассказывалось, что такое Википедия, а также излагались её история и основные правила.",Russian
"Диск и книга были изданы компанией Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH и продавались по той же цене, что и предыдущее издание.",Russian
Диск можно было бесплатно скачать в Интернете.,Russian
"В январе 2006 года Zenodot анонсировала выпуск печатного издания Википедии в 100 томах, по 800 страниц каждый.",Russian
Последний том планировалось выпустить в 2010 году.,Russian
"Позже было объявлено, что проект заморожен[98].",Russian
В декабре 2006 года был создан обновлённый образ диска.,Russian
"DVD не издавался, но доступен для скачивания с сайта dvd.wikimedia.org.",Russian
"DVD-диск с английской Википедией, содержащий 1964 статьи по основным темам, был выпущен в сотрудничестве с компанией Linterweb в январе 2007 года и обозначен как версия 0.5.",Russian
"В качестве оболочки использовалась среда Kiwix, программное обеспечение с открытым исходным кодом, специально написанное для данного издания.",Russian
В данный момент ведётся подготовка версий 0.7 и 1.0.,Russian
Последним на данный момент[когда?],Russian
был издан DVD польского раздела.,Russian
Его выпустило издательство Helion в конце июля 2007 года.,Russian
"Работа над изданием велась более года, на основе дампа от 4 июня 2006 года.",Russian
"База статей, имевшихся на тот момент, была скопирована на отдельный сервер, и их дорабатывали 13 оплачиваемых редакторов и около 20 добровольцев.",Russian
В итоге на диск вошло около 239 000 статей и 59 000 изображений.,Russian
Стоимость диска на момент выпуска составляла 39 злотых[99][100].,Russian
В 2009 году художник Роб Мэттьюс (англ.,Russian
Rob Matthews) распечатал избранные статьи английского раздела Википедии на 5000 страниц и сшил их в книгу с твёрдым переплётом.,Russian
Как он написал в пояснении к этому проекту: Воспроизведение Википедии в ущербной физической форме помогает легче ставить под сомнение разумность её использования.,Russian
В 2010 году английский писатель Джеймс Брайдл (англ.,Russian
"James Bridle) выпустил в единственном экземпляре двенадцатитомное издание объёмом 7000 страниц, озаглавленное «Иракская война: Историография изменений в Википедии», в котором отображена каждая правка в англоязычной статье про Иракскую войну с декабря 2004 года по ноябрь 2009 года[102].",Russian
"В дополнение к логистическому росту количества статей[103], Википедия неуклонно приобретала статус общего справочного сайта с момента её создания в 2001 году[104].",Russian
"На май 2018 года, согласно Alexa, Википедия занимала 5-е место среди самых посещаемых сайтов в мире[11], в Рунете — 9-е место[105].",Russian
В первой десятке Википедия является единственным некоммерческим сайтом.,Russian
Рост Википедии был вызван её доминирующей позицией в результатах поиска Google[106].,Russian
"Около 50 % трафика с поисковых систем в Википедию пришло с Google[107], большая часть этого трафика связана с научными исследованиями[108].",Russian
"В апреле 2007 года проектом Pew Internet & American Life Project было установлено, что треть американских интернет-пользователей консультируются с Википедией[109].",Russian
"По оценкам на октябрь 2006 года, сайт имел гипотетическую рыночную стоимость в 580 млн долларов, если бы он запустил рекламу.",Russian
"Википедия используется в образовательном процессе[110], научных исследованиях, книгах, конференциях, при отправлении правосудия[111][112], а также в работе различных министерств и ведомств.",Russian
"Так, сайт Парламента Канады ссылался на статью Википедии об однополых браках в разделе «Ссылки по теме» в списке «читать далее».",Russian
"Утверждения энциклопедии всё чаще используются в качестве источника такими организациями, как Федеральный суд США и Всемирная организация интеллектуальной собственности[113][неавторитетный источник?]",Russian
"— хотя в основном в качестве поддерживающей информации, а не информации, имеющей решающее значение для дела[114].",Russian
Содержание Википедии было цитировано в качестве источника и ссылки в некоторых докладах Разведывательного ведомства США[115].,Russian
"В 2013 году венгерские учёные показали, что с помощью Википедии можно предсказывать популярность и кассовые сборы фильмов, ещё не вышедших в прокат[116][117].",Russian
"Википедия была также использована в качестве источника в журналистике[118], иногда без указания авторства, а также несколько журналистов были уволены за плагиат из Википедии[119][120][121].",Russian
В июле 2007 года Википедии был посвящён 30-минутный документальный фильм на BBC Radio 4[122].,Russian
"Он утверждал, что количество ссылок на Википедию в популярной культуре таково, что этот термин является одним из группы избранных существительных XXI века, которые так узнаваемы (Google, Facebook, YouTube), что они больше не нуждаются в объяснениях и находятся на одном уровне с такими терминами XX века, как Hoovering или Coke.",Russian
"Существует много пародий на открытость Википедии с персонажами, вандализирующими или изменяющими статьи онлайн-энциклопедии.",Russian
"Примечательно, что комик Стивен Колберт пародировал Википедию или ссылался на Википедию в многочисленных эпизодах его шоу The Colbert Report и придумал соответствующий термин «wikiality»[123].",Russian
"Помимо выполнения функции энциклопедического справочника, Википедия стала главным объектом внимания СМИ как сетевой источник последних новостей[124][125].",Russian
"Когда популярный американский еженедельник Time признал некоего абстрактного представителя миллионов вкладчиков пользовательского контента в различные сайты, носящего обобщённое имя «ты», «Человеком года — 2006», тем самым отмечая ускоряющийся успех онлайн-сотрудничества и взаимодействия миллионов интернет-пользователей по всему миру, Википедия была наиболее часто упоминающимся проектом Веб 2.0, за которым следовали проекты YouTube и MySpace[126].",Russian
Википедия также создала формы воздействия на средства массовой информации (СМИ).,Russian
"Некоторые СМИ высмеивают восприимчивость Википедии к вставкам неточностей — например, статья на первой странице в The Onion в июле 2006 года под названием «„Википедия“ празднует 750 лет американской независимости»[127].",Russian
"Другие могут опираться на утверждение Википедии о том, что любой может править, — например «The Negotiation», эпизод сериала «Офис», где персонаж Майкл Скотт заявил: «„Википедия“ — лучшая вещь на свете.",Russian
"Любой в мире может написать всё, что хочет, по любому предмету; таким образом вы знаете, что получаете лучшую возможную информацию».",Russian
"Пародируются также правила Википедии, например, в комиксе xkcd «Wikipedian Protester».",Russian
"Первый документальный фильм о Википедии, озаглавленный «Истина в цифрах: Рассказ о Википедии», был выпущен в 2010 году.",Russian
28 сентября 2007 года итальянский политик Франко Гриллини инициировал парламентский запрос с министром культурных ресурсов и деятельности о необходимости свободы панорамы.,Russian
"Он сказал, что отсутствие такой свободы заставило Википедию, «седьмой сайт, с которым больше всего консультируются», запретить все изображения современных итальянских зданий и искусства, и заявил, что этим был нанесён очень серьёзный ущерб туристической отрасли.",Russian
"16 сентября 2007 года The Washington Post сообщила о том, что Википедия стала координационным центром избирательной кампании в США в 2008 году, заявив: «Введите имя кандидата в Google, и среди первых результатов будет страница Википедии, что делает эти статьи, возможно, такими же важными, как любое объявление в определении кандидата.",Russian
"В настоящее время уже президентские статьи редактируются, расчленяются и обсуждаются бесчисленное множество раз каждый день»[128].",Russian
"В октябре 2007 года статья Reuters, озаглавленная «Страница Википедии — последний символ статуса», сообщила о том, как наличие статьи в Википедии подтверждает статус знаменитости[129].",Russian
Википедия выиграла две крупные награды в мае 2004 года[130].,Russian
Первой была Золотая Ника цифрового сообщества на ежегодном конкурсе Prix Ars Electronica; она была получена вместе с грантом 10 000 € (6588 £; 12 700 $) и предоставлением приглашения присутствовать на PAE Cyberarts Festival в Австрии позднее в том же году.,Russian
Второй была судейская награда Webby в категории «сообщество»[131].,Russian
Википедия была также номинирована на «Лучшую практику» Webby.,Russian
"26 января 2007 года Википедия была также признана четвёртым высшим брендом в рейтинге читателей brandchannel.com, получив 15 % голосов в ответ на вопрос: «Какая марка имела наибольшее влияние на нашу жизнь в 2006 году?»[132].",Russian
"В сентябре 2008 года Википедия получила награду «Квадрига» A Mission of Enlightenment от Werkstatt Deutschland вместе с Борисом Тадичем, Eckart Höfling и Питером Габриэлем.",Russian
Награда была вручена Джимми Уэйлсу Дэвидом Вайнбергером[133].,Russian
"Википедия многократно получала российскую государственную Премию Рунета в нескольких номинациях, прежде всего как «научно-образовательный сайт года» в экспертных голосованиях и как лидер массовых онлайн-голосований («народная десятка»).",Russian
"Хотя Википедия позиционирует себя как вторичный источник информации[134], 2009 и 2018 годы были отмечены использованием материалов из Википедии как с атрибутированием к источникам[135][136], так и без ссылки[137].",Russian
"27 января 2013 года в «Циркуляре малых планет» была сделана запись, согласно которой «Астероид 274301», открытый украинскими астрономами 25 августа 2008 года, был назван «274301 Wikipedia»[138].",Russian
"Открытие было сделано в «Андрушевской астрономической обсерватории», находящейся в Житомирской области[138].",Russian
22 октября 2014 года в польском городе Слубице был открыт первый в мире памятник Википедии[139].,Russian
Учёными из Массачусетского технологического института (MIT) и Питтсбургского университета было проведено исследование об использовании ссылок на статьи из «Википедии» в научных работах.,Russian
"По словам авторов, его результаты свидетельствуют о том, что публикация научных знаний в доступных источниках является экономически эффективным способом продвижения науки, что особенно полезно для тех, кто не имеет доступа к традиционным источникам научной информации[140].",Russian
Время от времени некоторые страны закрывают или угрожают закрыть доступ к Википедии.,Russian
"В том числе: Исследовательский коллектив из Массачусетского технологического института и университета Питтсбурга установил прямую корреляцию между наличием информации в Википедии и вероятностью того, что учёные будут использовать её при работе над научными статьями и монографиями[143].",Russian
"Фонд Викимедиа, компания-владелец и организатор Википедии, поддерживает и другие проекты по созданию свободных публикаций в Интернете: Машинное обучение (англ.",Russian
"machine learning, ML) — класс методов искусственного интеллекта, характерной чертой которых является не прямое решение задачи, а обучение в процессе применения решений множества сходных задач.",Russian
"Для построения таких методов используются средства математической статистики, численных методов, математического анализа, методов оптимизации, теории вероятностей, теории графов, различные техники работы с данными в цифровой форме.",Russian
"Различают два типа обучения: Дедуктивное обучение принято относить к области экспертных систем, поэтому термины машинное обучение и обучение по прецедентам можно считать синонимами.",Russian
Многие методы индуктивного обучения разрабатывались как альтернатива классическим статистическим подходам.,Russian
Многие методы тесно связаны с извлечением информации (англ.,Russian
"information extraction, information retrieval), интеллектуальным анализом данных (data mining).",Russian
"Имеется множество объектов (ситуаций) и множество возможных ответов (откликов, реакций).",Russian
"Существует некоторая зависимость между ответами и объектами, но она неизвестна.",Russian
"Известна только конечная совокупность прецедентов — пар «объект, ответ», называемая обучающей выборкой.",Russian
"На основе этих данных требуется восстановить неявную зависимость, то есть построить алгоритм, способный для любого возможного входного объекта выдать достаточно точный классифицирующий ответ.",Russian
"Эта зависимость не обязательно выражается аналитически, и здесь нейросети реализуют принцип эмпирически формируемого решения.",Russian
"Важной особенностью при этом является способность обучаемой системы к обобщению, то есть к адекватному отклику на данные, выходящие за пределы имеющейся обучающей выборки.",Russian
Для измерения точности ответов вводится оценочный функционал качества.,Russian
Данная постановка является обобщением классических задач аппроксимации функций.,Russian
В классических задачах аппроксимации объектами являются действительные числа или векторы.,Russian
"В реальных прикладных задачах входные данные об объектах могут быть неполными, неточными, нечисловыми, разнородными.",Russian
Эти особенности приводят к большому разнообразию методов машинного обучения.,Russian
"Раздел машинного обучения, с одной стороны, образовался в результате разделения науки о нейросетях на методы обучения сетей и виды топологий их архитектуры, с другой стороны — вобрал в себя методы математической статистики.",Russian
"Указанные ниже способы машинного обучения исходят из случая использования нейросетей, хотя существуют и другие методы, использующие понятие обучающей выборки — например, дискриминантный анализ, оперирующий обобщённой дисперсией и ковариацией наблюдаемой статистики, или байесовские классификаторы.",Russian
"Базовые виды нейросетей, такие как перцептрон и многослойный перцептрон (а также их модификации), могут обучаться как с учителем, так и без учителя, с подкреплением и самоорганизацией.",Russian
Но некоторые нейросети и большинство статистических методов можно отнести только к одному из способов обучения.,Russian
"Поэтому, если нужно классифицировать методы машинного обучения в зависимости от способа обучения, будет некорректным относить нейросети к определенному виду, правильнее было бы типизировать алгоритмы обучения нейронных сетей.",Russian
Целью машинного обучения является частичная или полная автоматизация решения сложных профессиональных задач в самых разных областях человеческой деятельности.,Russian
Машинное обучение имеет широкий спектр приложений[источник не указан 2653 дня]: Сфера применений машинного обучения постоянно расширяется.,Russian
"Повсеместная информатизация приводит к накоплению огромных объёмов данных в науке, производстве, бизнесе, транспорте, здравоохранении.",Russian
"Возникающие при этом задачи прогнозирования, управления и принятия решений часто сводятся к обучению по прецедентам.",Russian
"Раньше, когда таких данных не было, эти задачи либо вообще не ставились, либо решались совершенно другими методами.",Russian
".мы все ищем быстрые способы научиться более свободно говорить по-английски, я знаю, я понимаю, что происходит: всего несколько слов крутятся в нашем мозгу, и нам нужно провести весь этот разговор, используя просто потрясающе круто или эпично, так как насчет нас выучите новые умные английские слова, которые можно использовать в повседневной жизни, и за несколько минут пополните свой словарный запас.",Russian

"У меня почти высшая оценка - слово «громадный» имеет классические латинские корни от слова, которое означает.",Russian
"«быть ошеломленным настолько потрясающе» используется для описания чего-то потрясающе хорошего, например, она потрясающе выглядит в этом платье, или какой потрясающий вид с этого балкона, или я читаю эту потрясающую книгу, от которой не могу оторваться.",Russian

flummox означает запутать кого-то.,Russian
"настолько, что они забывают, что делать, теперь запутаться - это часто употребляемое слово, поэтому вместо этого почему бы вам не использовать фламмокс, например, мальчик выглядел совершенно сбитым с толку, когда учитель задал ему вопрос в классе или собака выглядела смущенной при собственном отражении в зеркале или турист был сбит с толку разными обычаями.",Russian

золотой хлеб Когда-то в маленькой деревушке жила женщина по имени Марион.,Russian

"У меня вся эта грязь на моих прекрасных пальчиках, хуже того, что, если она хорошо попадет на мое лицо, это была проблема с Нарцисой.",Russian
"она считала себя слишком великой, чтобы выполнять какую-либо работу, многие женихи приходили просить нарцисса руки и сердца.",Russian
"поскольку ее красота была известна повсюду, но она отвергла их всех очень грубо, почему ты вчера прогнала этих мужчин, они казались милыми, ты не можешь быть серьезной мамой, одна из них.",Russian
"у него были такие маленькие глаза, почти как у птицы, а у другого был огромный нос, я бы не хотел быть рядом с ним.",Russian
"когда он чихнул, о, о, и последняя остановка, нет, я не хочу больше слышать, все, что я мог видеть, это то, что эти люди были действительно хорошими, моя дорогая, ты должна знать эту красоту.",Russian
"Не все, мама, ты должна понять, что я заслуживаю кого-то вроде принца или рыцаря.",Russian
"о, дорогая, однажды ночью, когда она спала, ее мать сидела рядом с ней и смотрела на нее.",Russian
"мое дорогое дитя, ты такая красивая и милая, но тебя не волнует ничего, кроме своей красоты.",Russian
"в этот момент Нарцисс начал смеяться во сне, ее мать была чрезвычайно удивлена, как хорошо ей, должно быть, снится действительно забавный сон на следующее утро, когда Нарцисс.",Russian
"Я проснулся, она вся улыбалась и хихикала, дорогая, расскажи мне, что тебе снилось.",Russian
"прошлой ночью, мама, это был такой потрясающий сон, ты знаешь, что ко мне подошел принц.",Russian
"и сказал, что хочет жениться на мне, он приехал в золотой карете, и он был одет сверху донизу и тоже золотом, что за глупый сон.",Russian
"и ты знаешь, лучшая часть этого была, когда я была в моем свадебном платье, которое тоже было золотым, конечно, все смотрели только на меня, Нарцисса, нет ничего удивительного в этом сне.",Russian
"Это был очень эгоистичный сон, мама, ты не понимаешь, о чем говоришь, этот сон заставил меня осознать, что мне нужна еда гораздо более грандиозная, чем та, которую я ем здесь, дома, хлеб из золота.",Russian
"только подумайте о той бедной матери-нарциссе, которая так волновалась за свою дочь и как.",Russian

"приготовилась ко сну, мама, я действительно надеюсь, что моя мечта сбудется, ты знаешь, о Нарцисса, на следующий день, когда Нарциса и ее мать были в саду в красивом месте.",Russian

"когда она остановилась, красивый мужчина вышел из нее и посмотрел на Нарцису, она была полностью поражена тем, насколько он красив, моя мечта на самом деле сбывается ммм.",Russian
"Привет, я пришел попросить нарцисса руки и сердца, но откуда ты знаешь ее имя и кто ты?",Russian
"Я Терренс, ангел удачи.",Russian
Имя твоей дочери и красота известны во всем мире.,Russian
Я принес тебе подарок.,Russian
"Но ты почти не знаешь его, ты не можешь пойти с ним.",Russian
"о, глупый, он богат и красив, чего еще мне еще нужно, Терренс, я принимаю ваше предложение.",Russian
"И с этими словами она села в его карету, и, даже не попрощавшись с матерью, уехала с ангелом, пока они ехали, карета внезапно вошла в волшебный портал, где она путешествовала по бурной местности, карета сильно ударилась и нарцисса.",Russian
"был очень напуган, не волнуйся, моя дорогая, все это скоро закончится, как только он сказал это, карета прошла через другой портал и достигла подъездной дорожки.",Russian
"огромного и великолепного золотого замка Нарциса была поражена всей красотой, которую она увидела, я знал, что заслуживаю столько богатств, я знал, что вам это понравится, все, что вы хотите, вы найдете здесь, от самых красивых платьев до самых вкусных блюд все это в моем дворце, хорошо говоря о еде, я действительно голоден после этой поездки.",Russian
"я голодаю, могу ли я съесть что-нибудь из этой вкусной еды, конечно, здесь мясо вонючая мелисса, она принесет тебе все, что ты хочешь, я так много слышал о тебе ты, бедный, дорогой, ты голоден Я принесу тебе немного еды, о, спасибо, они пошли в столовую, и там на столе была самая поразительная еда, которую Нарциса когда-либо видела удивительной, потому что это варенье.",Russian
"из рубинов салаты из изумрудов и хлеб там сделан из золотого золотого хлеба, как прекрасно это варенье будет выглядеть и вкусно с хлебом, который она взяла с собой.",Russian
"рубиновое варенье на нем и откусил огромный кусок, это так жарко, я не могу так хорошо есть, это хлеб из золота, и он тоже самый лучший, но если ты не можешь его съесть, должен я тебе достать серебряный хлеб ты ешь.",Russian
"что-то еще, но я хочу нормальный хлеб, который я могу съесть, разве ты не выглядишь так будущая жена моего отца, ракушка, холодно, ты должен есть только лучший нарцис.",Russian
Я смотрел на всю еду.,Russian
"но была убита горем из-за всего, что было несъедобным, она вскоре начала плакать, я не хочу этого, но еда действительно хорошая.",Russian
"вот попробуйте золотого картофеля, он действительно хорош, и после того, как вы выйдете за меня замуж.",Russian
"тебе придется все это съесть, я думал, тебе нравятся модные вещи, нет, я не хочу жениться на тебе, я хочу домой.",Russian
чтобы моя мать отпустила меня домой Мелисса и Терренс посмотрели друг на друга и хорошо подмигнули.,Russian
"Если это действительно то, чего ты хочешь, я отведу тебя домой, Терренс принял плачущий и несчастный.",Russian
"Нарцис дома в карете она начала глубоко думать о выборе, который она сделала, когда вернулась домой.",Russian
"она побежала обнять свою мать, которая сидела в доме грустная, ни сестра, о моя милая дочь, я думал, что никогда больше тебя не увижу.",Russian
"о, мама, я так тебя люблю, и ты была правильной внешностью, и богатство - это еще не все, золотой хлеб был бесполезен, потому что я не мог есть его и этого человека, хотя.",Russian
"он был красив, он вообще не заботился обо мне, но моя дорогая, ты понимаешь, что именно так ты относился к другим, я знаю, мне очень жаль, как я вела себя, мама, о нет, все в порядке, раз ты видела.",Russian
"в чем была твоя ошибка, давай с того дня накормим тебя чем-нибудь приятным.",Russian
"Нарциса изменила свой образ жизни, сначала она боролась, но постепенно и терпеливо она начала становиться намного лучше.",Russian
Однажды Мелли и Терри снова пришли встретиться с Мариан.,Russian
"О, привет, вы двое, так скажите нам Мэриан.",Russian
"Как' теперь нарциссизм Мэриан рассказал им обоим все, что произошло, и она так сильно изменилась с того времени.",Russian
"Думаю, она не хотела бы больше золотого хлеба, а ты знаешь.",Russian
"Терри вы на самом деле немного похожи на этого ангела, хотя что я вижу, как вы могли быть им, вы двое такие милые",Russian

"Nature è una delle più antiche ed importanti riviste scientifiche esistenti, forse in assoluto quella considerata di maggior prestigio nell'ambito della comunità scientifica internazionale (insieme a Science).",Italian
[1] Viene pubblicata fin dal 4 novembre 1869.,Italian
"[2] Nonostante la maggior parte delle riviste del campo siano oggi altamente specializzate, Nature è uno dei pochi giornali, insieme ad altri mensili quali Science e Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, che pubblica ancora articoli originali su svariati campi scientifici.",Italian
"Molti sono gli avanzamenti e le scoperte, provenienti da molti campi della ricerca scientifica, che sono stati pubblicati su Nature, come articoli o lettere: ad esempio, la scoperta dei raggi X, la natura ondulatoria delle particelle, la scoperta dei neutroni, le scoperte sulla fissione nucleare, la struttura a doppia elica del DNA, la prima struttura molecolare di una proteina (la mioglobina), la tettonica a zolle, il buco dell'ozono, la prima clonazione di un mammifero (la pecora Dolly), il sequenziamento del genoma umano.",Italian
"Il fattore di impatto (impact factor) di questa rivista supera nel 2014 l'enorme valore di 42,352.",Italian
"[3] Oltre a Nature stesso, ci sono tre famiglie di riviste scientifiche legate a Nature, edite dal Nature Publishing Group: In un'intervista pubblicata nel 2013 su The Guardian, Randy Schekman rilascia delle dichiarazioni riguardanti le grandi riviste scientifiche (facendo il nome di Nature, Science o Cell), additandole come colpevoli di danneggiare l'attività di ricerca scientifica.",Italian
"Secondo Randy Schekman l'incentivo più forte nella ricerca scientifica è quello di vedere pubblicate le proprie ricerche nelle prestigiose riviste scientifiche, poiché a questo viene fatto coincidere il più alto riconoscimento del proprio lavoro; tale ragionamento è razionale, ma non porta sempre a servire gli interessi della propria professione, né quelli dell'umanità o della società.",Italian
"Questo perché le grandi riviste scientifiche tendono a «curare in modo aggressivo i loro brand mettendo al primo posto la vendita di abbonamenti, più che la pubblicazione di tutte le ricerche più significative [...] mentre pubblicano molte ricerche rilevanti, tendono tuttavia a non pubblicare tutte le ricerche rilevanti, né sono gli unici a pubblicarle».",Italian
"Nell'articolo Randy Schekman critica sia la selezione assai restrittiva delle ricerche pubblicate da parte delle riviste scientifiche famose, sia l'impact factor, considerandolo come un trucco di marketing dietro il quale le grandi riviste acquistano notorietà; infatti l'impact factor misura solamente il numero delle volte che una determinata rivista scientifica risulta citata nelle ricerche scientifiche successive, senza considerare la qualità o l'importanza della ricerca stessa «una rivista scientifica può venire citata perché pubblica ricerche significative, o anche perché pubblica qualcosa di accattivante, provocativo o addirittura sbagliato».",Italian
"Questo influenza l'attività di ricerca, in quanto la indirizza in quella direzione dove è possibile tirare fuori le conclusioni che vogliono queste riviste, scoraggiando invece una direzione che potrebbe essere più importante, ma magari meno accattivante ai lettori.",Italian
"[4] Altri progetti Wikipedia (pronuncia: vedi sotto) è un'enciclopedia online a contenuto libero, collaborativa, multilingue e gratuita, nata nel 2001, sostenuta e ospitata dalla Wikimedia Foundation, un'organizzazione non a scopo di lucro statunitense.",Italian
"Lanciata da Jimmy Wales e Larry Sanger il 15 gennaio 2001, inizialmente nell'edizione in lingua inglese, nei mesi successivi ha aggiunto edizioni in numerose altre lingue.",Italian
"Sanger ne suggerì il nome,[1] una parola macedonia nata dall'unione della radice wiki al suffisso pedia (da enciclopedia).",Italian
"Etimologicamente, Wikipedia significa ""cultura veloce"", dal termine hawaiano wiki (veloce), con l'aggiunta del suffisso -pedia (dal greco antico παιδεία, paideia, formazione).",Italian
"Con più di 55 milioni di voci in oltre 300 lingue,[2] è l'enciclopedia più grande mai scritta,[3][4] è tra i dieci siti web più visitati al mondo[5] e costituisce la maggiore e più consultata opera di riferimento generalista su Internet.",Italian
"[6][7][8] Wikipedia prese il via come progetto complementare di Nupedia, un progetto per la creazione di un'enciclopedia libera online le cui voci erano scritte da esperti volontari attraverso un processo formale di revisione.",Italian
"Nupedia venne fondata il 9 marzo 2000 dalla società Bomis, proprietaria dell'omonimo portale di ricerca.",Italian
"Le figure principali erano Jimmy Wales, allora CEO della Bomis, e Larry Sanger, redattore capo di Nupedia e successivamente di Wikipedia.",Italian
"[9] Per il concetto di wiki, Wales e Sanger dichiararono di essersi ispirati ai siti WikiWikiWeb o Portland Pattern Repository di Ward Cunningham.",Italian
"Wikipedia, che esisteva già come servizio di Nupedia.com dal 10 gennaio 2001, fu formalmente lanciata il 15 gennaio successivo sul sito Wikipedia.com, in lingua inglese.",Italian
"Verso maggio giunsero i primi utenti registrati e, nel corso dell'anno, si svilupparono le edizioni in francese, tedesco, inglese, catalano, spagnolo, svedese, portoghese e, a fine anno, italiano.",Italian
"Alla fine del suo primo anno di esistenza, l'enciclopedia arrivò a contare quasi 20 000 voci, su 18 edizioni in lingue differenti.",Italian
"Raggiunse 26 edizioni in lingua alla fine del 2002, 46 alla fine del 2003 e 161 alla fine del 2004.",Italian
"Nupedia e Wikipedia coesistettero finché i server della prima furono chiusi definitivamente nel 2003 e i suoi testi incorporati in Wikipedia (Nupedia aveva sofferto un tasso di crescita estremamente lento, a causa dei complicati processi di revisione, riuscendo a pubblicare solo 24 voci); Sanger uscì di scena e un gruppo di utenti attuò una biforcazione della Wikipedia in spagnolo per costituire l'Enciclopedia Libre.",Italian
"Da Wikipedia e Nupedia, nacque nel 2003 la Wikimedia Foundation, l'organizzazione non profit che sostiene Wikipedia e i progetti fratelli (il primo dei quali fu In Memoriam: September 11 Wiki) che nel tempo si sono aggiunti, ognuno dei quali è specializzato in un determinato ambito del sapere.",Italian
"La Wikimedia Foundation ha infatti successivamente dato vita a progetti complementari tra i quali: Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikisource, Wikispecies, Wikiquote, Wikinotizie, Wikiversità e Wikivoyage.",Italian
"Wales cedette tutti i diritti alla fondazione da lui promossa, che tuttora gestisce i marchi e l'infrastruttura informatica, garantendo che la gestione dei contenuti rimanesse affidata alla comunità degli utenti.",Italian
"Se nei primi due anni cresceva alla velocità di poche centinaia o meno di nuove voci al giorno, l'edizione in inglese di Wikipedia raggiunse il traguardo delle 100 000 voci nel gennaio 2003, mentre nel 2004 subì un'esplosione, raddoppiando le dimensioni in un anno (con un aumento da 1 000 a 3 000 voci al giorno).",Italian
"Wikipedia ha raggiunto la sua milionesima voce, tra le 105 edizioni in lingua all'epoca presenti, il 20 settembre 2004.",Italian
"A partire dal 2004 è iniziata a costituirsi una rete di associazioni nazionali collegate alla Wikimedia Foundation (chiamati ""capitoli ufficiali""), tra le quali Wikimedia Italia, fondata nel 2005.",Italian
Nel settembre dello stesso anno l'edizione in italiano ha superato le 100 000 voci.,Italian
"Da quando Wikipedia ha raggiunto un considerevole numero di voci e di utilizzatori, è diventata un tipico fenomeno del Web 2.0, grazie anche alla sua particolarità di essere rapidamente modificabile e aggiornabile da chiunque.",Italian
"Nel settembre 2007, l'edizione in inglese ha tagliato lo storico traguardo di 2 milioni di voci, divenendo la più vasta enciclopedia mai scritta, superando l'enciclopedia Yongle (1407), che ha detenuto tale primato per 600 anni esatti;[3] nel Guinness dei primati del 2008 Wikipedia è riportata come la più grande enciclopedia al mondo.",Italian
"[4] Il 27 marzo 2008, con oltre 250 edizioni locali, ha raggiunto i 10 milioni di voci,[10] che erano raddoppiate il 18 novembre 2011[11] e triplicate nel giro dei tre anni successivi, superando nel 2015 i 35 milioni di voci.",Italian
"A settembre 2015 le edizioni di Wikipedia con più di 100 000 voci erano divenute 53, scritte in altrettante lingue, di cui 12 superavano il milione.",Italian
"[2] L'obiettivo di Wikipedia è creare un'enciclopedia libera, ovvero liberamente accessibile, a contenuto libero, aperto, e ""universale"" in termini di ampiezza di argomenti trattati.",Italian
"Wikipedia è stata descritta da Jimmy Wales, uno dei suoi fondatori, come «uno sforzo per creare e distribuire un'enciclopedia libera della più alta qualità possibile a ogni singola persona sul pianeta nella sua propria lingua.» Wikipedia, nelle intenzioni di Wales, doveva raggiungere nel lungo termine una qualità pari o migliore dell'Enciclopedia Britannica ed essere pubblicata anche su carta.",Italian
"Il progetto, ambizioso, ma realistico, si colloca dunque nell'ambito della condivisione della conoscenza e della cultura partecipativa sfruttando la cosiddetta intelligenza collettiva sulla base delle regole d'uso e di contribuzione espresse dall'enciclopedia stessa.",Italian
"In quanto enciclopedia a carattere universale (o ""generalista""), Wikipedia tratta voci di molti argomenti diversi.",Italian
Le voci sono organizzate in categorie tematiche; i temi generali sono generalmente illustrati da portali e coordinati tramite progetti.,Italian
"L'enciclopedia è completamente gratuita e priva di pubblicità, in linea con i suoi principi base: il suo sostentamento è dovuto unicamente alle libere donazioni degli utenti, grazie a una raccolta fondi[12] avviata ogni anno dalla Wikimedia Foundation.",Italian
"Il logo ufficiale di Wikipedia è una sfera quasi completa costruita con pezzi di puzzle che riportano caratteri di vari alfabeti, a simboleggiare il mondo e una conoscenza globale in costruzione, a disposizione di tutti.",Italian
Su Internet esistono o sono esistiti molti altri progetti enciclopedici.,Italian
"In generale dispongono di una linea editoriale stabilita e fanno uso delle tradizionali politiche sulla proprietà intellettuale dei contenuti, come per esempio l'Enciclopedia Stanford di Filosofia, compilata da esperti.",Italian
"Siti web più informali, come H2g2 o Everything2, servono come guide generali le cui voci sono scritte e controllate da persone comuni.",Italian
"Progetti come Wikipedia, Susning.nu e la Enciclopedia Libre sono invece wiki le cui voci sono sviluppate da numerosi autori e in cui non esiste alcun processo formale di revisione.",Italian
Wikipedia è il primo e più grande di questi wiki enciclopedici per numero di voci.,Italian
"A differenza delle enciclopedie che l'hanno preceduta, il contenuto di Wikipedia è distribuito con una licenza libera.",Italian
"Wikipedia è pubblicata in 309 lingue differenti (di cui circa 299 attive[2]) e contiene voci sia sugli argomenti propri di una tradizionale enciclopedia sia su quelli di almanacchi, dizionari geografici e specialistici.",Italian
"Il suo scopo è quello di raccogliere dati, informazioni e descrizioni, creando e distribuendo al pubblico un'enciclopedia libera, gratuita e sempre più ricca di contenuti.",Italian
"Le varie edizioni in lingua sono sviluppate indipendentemente l'una dall'altra, ovvero non sono vincolate ai contenuti presenti nelle altre, ma sono tenute unicamente al rispetto delle linee guida generali del progetto come il punto di vista neutrale.",Italian
"I testi delle voci e i contenuti multimediali tuttavia sono spesso condivisi tra le varie edizioni: i primi grazie alle traduzioni, i secondi attraverso il progetto condiviso chiamato Wikimedia Commons.",Italian
Le voci tradotte rappresentano una percentuale relativamente piccola di quelle presenti in ciascuna edizione.,Italian
"Le edizioni in lingua tedesca, quella in lingua italiana e una selezione di voci tratte dalla versione in lingua inglese sono state distribuite anche su compact disc e DVD, mentre di molte edizioni sono stati creati dei mirror online o dei progetti derivati.",Italian
"Ad agosto 2015 Wikipedia conteneva in totale più di 35 milioni di voci - in totale oltre 135 milioni di pagine, modificate oltre 2 miliardi di volte - e contava oltre 55 milioni di utenti registrati.",Italian
"[2] Wikipedia è uno dei dieci siti più visitati al mondo, oscillando nel 2015 tra il sesto e il settimo posto nella classifica mondiale:[13] riceve infatti oltre 374 milioni di visitatori unici al mese (a settembre 2015).",Italian
[che sito si intende?,Italian
"wikipedia.org, en.wikipedia.org o tutte le edizioni linguistiche assieme?",Italian
][14] Le voci di Wikipedia sono spesso citate dai mass media tradizionali e da istituti accademici.,Italian
"«""L'enciclopedia partecipata"" mi preoccupa meno: la uso regolarmente, e trovo che la qualità e l'affidabilità delle informazioni sia notevole.",Italian
Qualche problema c'è solo quando il soggetto è estremamente controverso.,Italian
"In questo caso la neutralità e le reciproche obiezioni spingono verso il minimo comun denominatore, e bisogna accontentarsi.",Italian
"Ma questo è inevitabile, e in fondo accadeva già con le enciclopedie tradizionali.» La caratteristica primaria di Wikipedia è il fatto che dà la possibilità a chiunque di collaborare, utilizzando un sistema di modifica e pubblicazione aperto che si appoggia su una piattaforma Wiki (MediaWiki).",Italian
In altri termini essa è curata da volontari ovvero le pagine possono essere modificate da chiunque e non c'è un comitato di redazione né alcun controllo preventivo sul contenuto inviato.,Italian
"In particolare essa si basa sul diritto di citazione come testimonianza di attendibilità dei contenuti presenti che citino dunque la fonte di origine, classificandosi dunque come fonte terziaria.",Italian
"La registrazione non è obbligatoria, ma consigliata.",Italian
"A causa della sua natura aperta, vandalismi e imprecisioni sono problemi riscontrabili in Wikipedia.",Italian
"Il miglioramento dell'enciclopedia è dovuto unicamente al continuo apporto di contributi sia in termini di nuovi contenuti che di revisioni degli stessi, della forma e della formattazione secondo le linee guida da parte di tutti gli utenti volontari[16].",Italian
Caratteristica delle voci di Wikipedia è inoltre l'avere frequenti collegamenti ipertestuali ad altre voci dell'enciclopedia che permettono una facile navigazione nel Portale e un più facile approfondimento di altre voci con uno stile dunque che ricorda il Web 1.0 o Web statico mentre di fatto la piattaforma Mediawiki appartiene al Web 2.0 o Web dinamico.,Italian
"Tutte le voci sono comunemente rintracciabili tramite ricerca web con Google, che solitamente indicizza tra le prime posizioni, ma l'enciclopedia può essere vista come un vero e proprio portale web il cui accesso è dalla Pagina Principale che fornisce in primo piano una voce del giorno, una voce di qualità, ricorrenze del giorno, un motore di ricerca interno ecc.",Italian
Le foto delle varie voci provengono dal progetto Wikimedia Commons sui cui vengono caricate e poi richiamate nelle voci di Wikipedia.,Italian
"Per garantire tale progresso, Wikipedia si fonda su cinque pilastri, sulle seguenti linee guida, volte ad identificare quali tipi di informazioni siano adatte a esservi inserite e su un codice di comportamento detto Wikiquette.",Italian
"Ad esse si fa spesso riferimento nelle dispute per decidere se un particolare contenuto debba essere aggiunto, rivisto, trasferito ad un progetto affine oppure rimosso.",Italian
"Uno dei principi alla base di Wikipedia è il ""punto di vista neutrale"",[17] secondo il quale ad esempio le opinioni presentate da personaggi importanti o da opere letterarie vengono riassunte senza tentare di determinarne una verità oggettiva.",Italian
Le edizioni di Wikipedia contengono spesso anche uno ''sportello informazioni'' in cui la comunità risponde alle domande tecniche degli utenti.,Italian
"Originariamente pubblicata sotto la licenza libera GFDL, dal 15 giugno 2009 è migrata alla licenza Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0, più compatibile con gli scopi e gli usi di Wikipedia e in generale dei progetti Wikimedia (le licenze Creative Commons non esistevano nel 2001 alla nascita del progetto).",Italian
Il cambiamento di licenza è stato sottoposto a votazione della comunità.,Italian
"[18][19] La licenza sotto la quale le voci di Wikipedia sono rese disponibili è una delle molte licenze di copyright di tipo permissivo (ma dal copyleft di tipo ""forte""), in quanto permette la redistribuzione, la creazione di opere derivate e l'uso commerciale del contenuto a condizione che si mantenga l'attribuzione agli autori e che il contenuto rimanga disponibile sotto la stessa licenza.",Italian
"Quando un utente contribuisce al progetto con materiale originale, i diritti d'autore rimangono in suo possesso ma egli acconsente a concedere la propria opera sotto la licenza libera.",Italian
"Il materiale di Wikipedia può quindi essere distribuito a, o incorporato da, fonti che a loro volta usino questa licenza.",Italian
Del contenuto di Wikipedia sono stati creati numerosi mirror o progetti derivati a partire da copie dei database.,Italian
"Sebbene tutti i testi siano disponibili sotto la stessa licenza, una percentuale significativa di immagini e suoni in Wikipedia non sono liberi: elementi come loghi aziendali, saggi, testi di canzoni o foto giornalistiche protette da copyright sono usate con una rivendicazione di fair use (tuttavia, in alcuni Paesi il concetto di fair use non è presente nel corpo legislativo, e quindi opere che contenessero questi elementi potrebbero essere inammissibili).",Italian
Wikipedia ha ricevuto anche del materiale a condizione che non si possano produrre lavori derivati o che possa essere usato solo all'interno di Wikipedia.,Italian
Alcune edizioni comunque accettano solo contenuti multimediali liberi da copyright.,Italian
"Wikipedia condivide le risorse software e hardware con gli altri progetti della Wikimedia Foundation, in particolare il motore che interpreta il markup delle pagine (MediaWiki) e i server su cui sono salvati i database che contengono le pagine dell'enciclopedia.",Italian
A maggio 2017 sono presenti 296 diverse edizioni linguistiche di Wikipedia (di cui 285 attive).,Italian
"La versione in lingua italiana di Wikipedia è soprannominata it.wiki ed è nata a maggio del 2001, sotto il nome a dominio di terzo livello it.wikipedia.org.",Italian
Nel 2003 nascono le Wikipedia in latino e in occitano.,Italian
"Ad aprile 2004 nasce la Wikipedia in sardo, poi a ottobre la Wikipedia in siciliano, a gennaio 2005 la Wikipedia in friulano e a seguire, nel corso del 2005, le versioni linguistiche in corso, napoletano, romancio, veneto e lombardo.",Italian
"Nel 2006 sono nate poi le edizioni in ligure, piemontese, francoprovenzale e tarantino.",Italian
Nel 2007 è nata quella in emiliano e romagnolo.,Italian
"La creazione della Wikipedia in lingua ladina è stata in fase di test fino al 2020, quando è stata resa operativa.",Italian
"[20] Il nome Wikipedia è composto dal prefisso wiki- (dall'hawaiano wiki, veloce), e dal suffisso -pedia (dal greco antico paideia, formazione).",Italian
"Il progetto non prevede una pronuncia ufficiale del suo nome proprio, ma lascia libertà di pronunciarlo secondo le proprie preferenze.",Italian
"La pronuncia vichipedìa sarebbe preferibile in quanto linguisticamente più integrata, considerando la pronuncia consolidata in lingua italiana del suffisso -pedìa (-pedìa /peˈdia/, come in enciclopedia)[21] e la pronuncia consolidata della lettera w di wiki (vìchi /ˈviki/, come in wafer o wc).",Italian
[21][22] Anche l'Accademia della Crusca si è espressa analogamente in più occasioni.,Italian
"[23] Le pronunce anglicizzanti (o inglesi italianizzate), meno integrate nel sistema linguistico dell'italiano, sono tuttavia diffuse.",Italian
"Il Dizionario di pronuncia italiana di Luciano Canepari, uniformandosi alla pronuncia inglese, riporta /wikiˈpɛdja/ (uichipèdia) come forma primaria, /wikiˈpidja/ (uichipìdia) come accettabile e /wikipeˈdia/ (uichipedìa) come pronuncia intenzionale «per fare sfoggio».",Italian
"[24] In inglese si dice comunemente [ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə] o [ˌwiːkiˈpiːdiə], ma non esiste una pronuncia ufficiale.",Italian
"Wikipedia non è regolata da alcun comitato di redazione centrale: le sue voci sono scritte spontaneamente da centinaia di migliaia di volontari non remunerati né iscritti ad associazioni, che si organizzano autonomamente stabilendo da soli le regole interne e lo svolgimento degli argomenti nelle voci.",Italian
"Wikipedia, infatti, è costruita sulla convinzione che la collaborazione tra gli utenti possa nel tempo migliorare le voci, più o meno nello stesso spirito con cui viene sviluppato il software libero.",Italian
"Nel caso del software, se è libero, chiunque può prelevarne i sorgenti, modificarli e ridistribuirli, eppure solitamente i programmatori si limitano a proporre alcune modifiche agli autori, i quali le adottano oppure no a loro insindacabile giudizio.",Italian
Le voci sono sempre aperte alle modifiche (tranne quando vengono protette a tempo determinato a causa di vandalismi o edit war) e non si dichiara mai conclusa la stesura di una voce.,Italian
"Accade che alcuni utenti provino a inserire informazioni malevole o goliardiche, ma enciclopedicamente irrilevanti, che vengono generalmente rimosse prontamente da altri utenti.",Italian
Questo tipo di modifiche è in gergo chiamato vandalismo.,Italian
Wikipedia mantiene un approccio ottimistico sulla bontà delle modifiche proposte: tutti coloro che visitano il sito di Wikipedia hanno la possibilità di creare o modificare una voce e vedere pubblicate all'istante le loro modifiche.,Italian
"Gli autori delle voci, che non devono avere necessariamente alcuna competenza o qualifica formale sugli argomenti trattati ma devono basare le proprie pubblicazioni su fonti autorevoli, sono però avvertiti che i loro contributi possono essere cancellati, o a loro volta modificati e redistribuiti da chiunque, nei termini della licenza e delle linee guida interne a Wikipedia.",Italian
"Le voci sono controllate dalla comunità, con il supporto di un gruppo di amministratori che svolgono alcune azioni tecniche.",Italian
"Le decisioni da prendere sul contenuto e sulle politiche editoriali di Wikipedia sono ottenute di norma per consenso[25] e in alcuni casi per votazione, sebbene per alcuni anni Jimmy Wales si fosse riservato decisioni in alcuni casi nell'edizione in inglese.",Italian
"Grazie al software wiki, tutte le modifiche alle voci di Wikipedia sono archiviate in una cronologia delle versioni accessibile a chiunque.",Italian
"Wikipedia perciò è anche la prima tra le grandi enciclopedie che permette a tutti di osservare il processo di sviluppo nel tempo di una voce e di verificare se, come e dove il contenuto è stato oggetto di controversie.",Italian
Persino le cancellazioni e gli altri vandalismi che una pagina subisce sono di norma visibili a tutti.,Italian
"Tutti i punti di vista contestati, espressi in un dato momento e successivamente cancellati, rimangono consultabili e forniscono informazioni complementari sull'argomento di cui è oggetto la voce e sul suo grado di controversia, aggiungendovi inoltre la dimensione temporale.",Italian
Oltre all'editor classico che utilizza un linguaggio di markup estremamente semplificato (ad es.,Italian
"molto più semplice dell'HTML) il software MediaWiki mette a disposizione anche un editor visuale, chiamato VisualEditor.",Italian
"Nel gergo di Wikipedia gli autori - cioè quegli utenti che collaborano attivamente all'inserimento dei contenuti - sono chiamati ""wikipediani"" e formano un'ampia e variegata comunità di pratica.",Italian
"L'attività di wikipediano è riconosciuta come ""profilo professionale"" dall'IWA (International Webmasters Association).",Italian
[26] Su Wikipedia non vi sono distinzioni formali tra chi collabora al progetto: le decisioni sono idealmente prese raggiungendo il consenso tra coloro che sono coinvolti.,Italian
"Nel mese di giugno 2015, gli utenti attivi (cioè quelli che avevano contribuito a Wikipedia con almeno cinque interventi ciascuno) erano 71 000[27] (oltre 40 000 nell'ambito delle tre edizioni maggiori, ovvero quelle in lingua inglese, tedesca e giapponese).",Italian
"Il gruppo più attivo, composto da quasi 10 000 utenti (di cui circa il 50% lavorava nelle tre edizioni maggiori), ha fornito 100 contributi o più a testa nel corso del mese.",Italian
"[28] Secondo Wikimedia un quarto del traffico di Wikipedia proviene da utenti non registrati, che difficilmente diventeranno collaboratori stabili.",Italian
"I lavori di manutenzione sono svolti da un gruppo di volontari che sono chiamati, a seconda del ruolo, sviluppatori,[29] steward,[30] check user,[31] oversight,[32] burocrati[33] e amministratori;[34] nel complesso alcune migliaia di persone.",Italian
"Gli amministratori (sysop) sono i più numerosi (oltre quattromila al 2015) e sono loro attribuite alcune funzioni tecniche aggiuntive che servono ad impedire, in caso di necessità, la modifica di singole voci, di cancellare e ripristinare le voci o di togliere (in modo temporaneo o permanente) ad alcuni utenti la facoltà di modificare Wikipedia, seguendo quanto stabilito dalle linee guida della comunità.",Italian
"Non essendo gli amministratori dei moderatori, il controllo e l'eliminazione dei vandalismi sono a carico di tutta la comunità degli utenti.",Italian
"Gli atti di vandalismo o le infrazioni più lievi alle linee guida possono comportare un avvertimento o un blocco temporaneo, mentre i blocchi a lungo termine o permanenti in conseguenza di infrazioni prolungate e gravi sono in genere decisi dalla comunità o, in alcune edizioni, da un comitato arbitrale.",Italian
"[35] L'ex redattore capo di Wikipedia Larry Sanger ha affermato che avere la licenza libera GFDL come ""garanzia di libertà, è una forte motivazione a lavorare in un'enciclopedia libera"".",Italian
"In uno studio su Wikipedia come comunità, il docente di economia Andrea Ciffolilli[36] sostenne che il basso costo di transazione nella partecipazione ad un software wiki crea un catalizzatore per lo sviluppo collaborativo e che un approccio alla ""costruzione creativa"" incoraggia la partecipazione.",Italian
Wikipedia è stata vista come un esperimento sociale di democrazia.,Italian
"Il suo fondatore ha replicato che non è stata pensata come tale, ma piuttosto ne è una conseguenza.",Italian
"[37] In una pagina a proposito del fare ricerche con Wikipedia, i suoi autori spiegano che Wikipedia è importante come comunità sociale: agli autori di voci può venir chiesto di difendere o spiegare il loro operato e le discussioni sono immediatamente visibili.",Italian
"Wikipedia possiede una comunità di utenti che sono in proporzione pochi, ma molto attivi.",Italian
"William G. Emigh e Susan C. Herring (2005) affermano che «pochi utenti attivi, quando agiscono in concerto con norme stabilite all'interno di un sistema redazionale aperto, possono raggiungere il controllo totale sul contenuto prodotto nel sistema, cancellando letteralmente diversità, controversie e inconsistenze, e omogeneizzando le voci dei collaboratori.»[38] I redattori di Wikinfo, un progetto derivato da Wikipedia, sostengono analogamente che i contributori nuovi o controversi di Wikipedia sono spesso ingiustamente etichettati troll o utenti problematici e viene loro impedito di apportare modifiche.",Italian
La comunità di Wikipedia è stata anche criticata per il fatto di rispondere alle lamentele riguardo alla qualità di una voce consigliando a chi si lamenta di correggere la voce.,Italian
"Wikipedia richiede ai propri collaboratori di osservare un punto di vista neutrale[17] quando scrivono e di non inserire alcuna ricerca originale, dal momento che un'enciclopedia è una fonte terziaria.",Italian
"Questa condotta, se rigorosamente applicata, mette al sicuro l'enciclopedia da eventuali minacce legali per reati di diffamazione e al contempo le conferisce obiettività e affidabilità.",Italian
"Il punto di vista neutrale, di per sé una linea di condotta non negoziabile, rende chiaro che l'obiettivo dell'enciclopedia è quello di presentare le dispute e descriverle piuttosto che impegnarsi per esse.",Italian
"Qualora fosse completamente raggiunto, Wikipedia non si troverebbe ad essere scritta sulla base di un singolo punto di vista ""oggettivo"", ma a presentare in modo imparziale tutti gli aspetti di una questione, attribuendoli in modo neutrale ai propri sostenitori.",Italian
Questa politica impone che ciascun punto di vista debba ricevere una trattazione adeguata al suo seguito.,Italian
"Le opinioni e teorie inedite sono considerate ""ricerche originali"" e non sono pubblicabili in Wikipedia, dato che sono incompatibili con il concetto di enciclopedia (che è un'opera compilativa) e non possono essere presentate secondo un punto di vista neutrale e con fonti indipendenti.",Italian
I collaboratori di Wikipedia mantengono in più una varietà di politiche e linee guida minori.,Italian
"Al contrario di altri progetti basati su wiki, come il Portland Pattern Repository di Ward Cunningham (considerato l'inventore del wiki), i wikipediani usano le cosiddette pagine di discussione[39] per discutere le modifiche alle voci, piuttosto che farlo all'interno delle voci stesse.",Italian
"I collaboratori di Wikipedia spesso modificano, spostano e cancellano le voci che sono considerate inadatte a un'enciclopedia, come le definizioni da dizionario (per cui esistono progetti appositi come il Wikizionario) o testi da fonti originali.",Italian
"Le varie edizioni di Wikipedia, facenti capo a comunità distinte su base linguistica, stabiliscono autonomamente le proprie convenzioni stilistiche.",Italian
Il contenuto di Wikipedia viene distribuito in diverse modalità.,Italian
"A parte la distribuzione nella sua forma originale online, attraverso i siti ufficiali o i molti mirror creati su altri server web, anche le versioni stampate o pronte alla stampa di Wikipedia hanno ottenuto popolarità.",Italian
I cosiddetti WikiReader (pubblicazioni su carta con selezioni di voci) sono stati lanciati dalla Wikipedia tedesca nel tardo febbraio 2004 con il primo WikiReader sulla Svezia di Thomas Karcher.,Italian
Hanno fatto seguito altri WikiReader preparati nel formato PDF o con le versioni stampate in preparazione per la vendita.,Italian
"L'esempio tedesco è stato ripreso altrove per cui sono nati altri progetti WikiReader ad opera degli utenti cinesi, inglesi, francesi e polacchi.",Italian
Wikipress[40] ha messo in vendita un libro in brossura dell'edizione 2005-2006 comprensivo di un DVD.,Italian
"In seguito, nel 2009, è stata aggiunta a Wikipedia un'estensione con la quale ogni utente può raccogliere più voci dell'enciclopedia in ""libri"" che possono essere consultati offline e distribuiti come e-book gratuiti o anche essere stampati in volume grazie ad un servizio online a pagamento.",Italian
Sono disponibili anche CD e DVD di Wikipedia.,Italian
Il progetto tedesco di Wikipedia è stato il primo a distribuire una versione su questi supporti nel 2004; attualmente è giunto alla seconda edizione.,Italian
"A partire dal settembre 2007 anche l'edizione in italiano di Wikipedia è stata pubblicata in una versione in DVD, diventando così la seconda ad essere distribuita su tale supporto.",Italian
"[41] I contenuti di Wikipedia sono consultabili anche tramite dispositivi mobili (cellulari, palmari, smartphone, ecc.).",Italian
"Esiste infatti una versione mobile del sito, che consente di accedere alle voci di Wikipedia presentandole in una veste grafica semplificata, adatta per questo tipo di dispositivi.",Italian
"Il servizio QRpedia consente di generare codici QR contenenti particolari link che permettono di accedere alla versione di Wikipedia mobile di una data voce, puntando automaticamente alla pagina nella stessa lingua del dispositivo in uso.",Italian
"Sono disponibili inoltre applicazioni dedicate per i vari dispositivi mobili, ad esempio Wikipedia Mobile per iPhone e Wikipedia Mobile per Android.",Italian
"«L'atteggiamento dell'accademico medio verso il principale strumento di consultazione della nostra epoca, e in particolare dei nostri studenti, conferma conclusioni cui eravamo già arrivati.",Italian
"Egli quasi sempre consulta Wikipedia (non per propria scelta, ma perché i motori di ricerca lo dirigono automaticamente alle sue voci), ma non prende in considerazione la possibilità di contribuirvi per tre motivi principali: perché la ritiene di livello troppo basso nel proprio settore specialistico; perché ritiene sé stesso troppo incompetente in qualsiasi altro settore e perché non ha tempo da perdere in lavori che non assicurano né compensi economici né titoli utili alla carriera.» La reputazione di Wikipedia quale mezzo di consultazione è soggetta a discussioni di opposti orientamenti: da una parte elogiata per la sua libera distribuzione, libera compilazione e ampia gamma di argomenti trattati, dall'altra criticata per presunti pregiudizi sistemici (secondo cui vengono privilegiate le voci di interesse dei singoli contributori indipendentemente dalla loro oggettiva importanza), lacune su alcuni argomenti e mancanza di responsabilità e autorità in rapporto alle enciclopedie tradizionali.",Italian
"Anche il concetto di ""enciclopedia"" di Wikipedia è oggetto di dibattito, a maggior ragione da quando essa ha incrementato la sua importanza.",Italian
"Le critiche più frequenti riguardano una mancanza di affidabilità, conoscenza e autorevolezza.",Italian
"La critica più forte riguarda l'affidabilità in termini di contenuti; fermo restando la natura work in progress dell'opera ovvero la continua tendenza al miglioramento nel tempo in termini di completezza e affidabilità dei contenuti, al riguardo uno studio della rivista Nature del 2008, che ha messo a confronto la versione inglese di Wikipedia con la famosa enciclopedia Britannica, ha evidenziato una differenza minima in termini di errori tra le due (4 errori in media per ciascuna voce di Wikipedia e 3 per la Britannica).",Italian
"[42] Addetti ai lavori del mondo cartaceo (bibliotecari, accademici, redattori ed editori di enciclopedie classiche) considerano invece Wikipedia di scarsa o nulla utilità quale mezzo di consultazione.",Italian
"Per contro altri ritengono Wikipedia di qualità sufficiente in almeno alcune aree, in questo sostenuti dal fatto che essa ha vinto un test comparativo proposto da c't, rivista tedesca di informatica.",Italian
Molti degli elogi le sono attribuiti per il fatto di essere sia a contenuto libero sia aperta alle modifiche di chiunque.,Italian
"I redattori stessi di Wikipedia sono stati piuttosto attivi nel valutare, sia positivamente sia negativamente, l'enciclopedia.",Italian
"Una forte critica, nel 2007 viene da Robert Cailliau — uno degli ideatori del web[43] — che ha affermato che Wikipedia «…rappresenta proprio ciò che non volevamo che diventasse il web»; questo perché Wikipedia concentra in un solo ""luogo"" un gran numero di informazioni, invece nelle menti degli ideatori vi era una struttura a rete, in cui la parte tecnica, ma anche le informazioni fossero distribuite equamente sui suoi nodi, in modo che se venisse a mancare uno di questi nodi non si formasse una voragine d'informazione.",Italian
"[44] Di fatto Wikipedia funziona molto efficacemente come un aggregatore di informazioni e notizie provenienti da numerose fonti primarie (cartacee e web) di fronte all'enorme numero di informazioni disperse nel web, cresciute con il web stesso, stimolando allo stesso tempo la condivisione del sapere in rete e il senso di responsabilità.",Italian
"Allo stesso tempo i difensori e fruitori ne esaltano la ""portabilità"" rispetto alle enciclopedie cartacee ovvero la disponibilità a portata di un ""click"".",Italian
"Per questo Wikipedia è stata usata dai media, da membri della comunità accademica e da altri come fonte informativa principale o secondaria.",Italian
"Alcuni organi d'informazione hanno citato le voci di Wikipedia come fonte o le hanno segnalate tra le informazioni aggiuntive disponibili sul Web, in alcuni casi in modo reiterato.",Italian
"Secondo gli elenchi tenuti dai contributori di Wikipedia, le sue voci sono state citate con maggiore frequenza nei media di contenuto informativo, e più raramente anche in studi accademici, libri, conferenze e aule giudiziarie.",Italian
"Ad esempio, il sito del Parlamento del Canada cita la voce inglese di Wikipedia sui matrimoni gay tra le letture consigliate riguardo al proprio progetto di legge C-38.",Italian
Alcuni utenti mantengono liste (incomplete) dei casi in cui Wikipedia è stata citata come fonte.,Italian
I critici sostengono che l'accesso in scrittura a chiunque renda Wikipedia un prodotto inaffidabile.,Italian
"Wikipedia non contiene alcun processo formale e sistematico di revisione e, dunque, di controllo dei fatti: gli stessi contributori potrebbero non essere esperti negli argomenti di cui scrivono.",Italian
Il bibliotecario e consulente per Internet Philip Bradley dichiarò nel 2004 al britannico Guardian di non avere intenzione di utilizzare Wikipedia e di non essere «a conoscenza di un solo bibliotecario che lo farebbe.,Italian
Il problema principale è la mancanza di autorevolezza.,Italian
"Per le pubblicazioni stampate, gli editori devono garantire che i loro dati siano attendibili in quanto il loro sostentamento dipende da ciò.",Italian
"Ma con qualcosa come questo, tutto ciò perde di significato».",Italian
[45] Analogamente il direttore responsabile dell'Encyclopædia Britannica Ted Pappas disse al Guardian: «Il presupposto di Wikipedia è che il continuo miglioramento porterà alla perfezione.,Italian
Tale presupposto non è assolutamente dimostrato».,Italian
"Nel discutere su Wikipedia come fonte accademica Danah Boyd, ricercatrice presso la School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS) dell'Università della California a Berkeley, scrisse nel 2005 che «[Wikipedia] non sarà mai un'enciclopedia, ma conterrà una vasta conoscenza piuttosto valida per diversi scopi».",Italian
"Alcuni articoli accademici sottoposti a revisione paritaria, come quelli pubblicati sulla rivista scientifica Science, hanno riportato dei riferimenti a voci di Wikipedia.",Italian
L'atteggiamento del mondo scientifico verso Wikimedia come strumento di consultazione non è stato solo negativo.,Italian
Le voci di Wikipedia sono state citate nelle enhanced perspectives (abstract delle più recenti ed entusiasmanti ricerche scientifiche) disponibili on line sul sito di Science.,Italian
"Il primo di tali abstract ad avere un link a Wikipedia fu A White Collar Protein Senses Blue Light (Linden, 2002), e da allora altre ne seguirono.",Italian
"Tali collegamenti, tuttavia, sono proposti al lettore solo come letture supplementari e non come fonti usate dall'autore dell'articolo, e le enhanced perspectives non sono pensate per servire, esse stesse, da materiale di riferimento.",Italian
"In un articolo del 2004, The Faith-Based Encyclopedia (L'enciclopedia basata sulla fiducia) l'ex direttore della Britannica Robert McHenry, criticò l'approccio wiki, sostenendo che «…per quanto vicina — in qualche momento della sua vita — al raggiungimento della credibilità, una voce di Wikipedia è sempre aperta a qualche ficcanaso poco informato o semi acculturato… L'utente che visita Wikipedia per apprendere qualche argomento, per confermare qualche dato di fatto, è piuttosto nella posizione dell'avventore di un bagno pubblico.",Italian
"Potrebbe essere palesemente sporco, così che egli sa di dover fare molta attenzione, o potrebbe sembrare discretamente pulito, così che egli potrebbe farsi cullare dal falso senso di sicurezza.",Italian
Ciò che certamente non può sapere è chi ha usato i servizi prima di lui».,Italian
Per rispondere a tale critica sono stati proposti metodi per indicare l'origine del materiale nelle voci di Wikipedia.,Italian
"L'idea è di fornire una provenienza della fonte su ciascun intervallo del testo di una voce, e una provenienza temporale per indicarne l'annata.",Italian
"In questo modo il lettore può conoscere «chi ha usato i servizi prima di lui» e quanto tempo la comunità ha impiegato per elaborare e giudicare le informazioni contenute in una voce allo scopo di fornire una calibratura sul ""senso di sicurezza"".",Italian
"Comunque, queste proposte riguardanti la provenienza sono abbastanza controverse.",Italian
"Uno degli ideatori del progetto, Larry Sanger, criticò Wikipedia nel 2004, per la sua supposta filosofia anti-elitaria di attivo disprezzo per la competenza.",Italian
"Il processo di redazione di Wikipedia presuppone che l'esposizione di una voce a molti utenti conduca, con il tempo di per sé, all'accuratezza.",Italian
"Facendo riferimento alla Legge di Linus sullo sviluppo open source, Sanger aveva in passato sostenuto che «dati sufficienti occhi, tutti gli errori sono superficiali».",Italian
"Jōichi Itō, personaggio di spicco del mondo tecnologico, ha poi scritto, a proposito dell'autorità in Wikipedia, che «sebbene dipenda un po' dall'argomento, l'interrogativo è se qualcosa sia con tutta probabilità vera quando provenga da una fonte il cui curriculum suoni autorevole oppure da una fonte che sia stata esaminata da centinaia di migliaia di persone (con la capacità di commentare) e sia sopravvissuta».",Italian
"Al contrario, in un test informale sulla capacità di Wikipedia di individuare informazioni errate, l'autore sottolineò che il processo usato in Wikipedia «non è realmente un meccanismo in grado di verificare i fatti tanto quanto lo sarebbe un meccanismo di voto» e che un materiale che non apparisse apertamente falso verrebbe accettato come vero.",Italian
Wikipedia è stata accusata di insufficienza nella conoscenza a causa della sua natura volontaria e di riflettere i pregiudizi sistemici dei suoi collaboratori.,Italian
"Il redattore capo della Britannica, Dale Hoiberg, ha commentato che «le persone scrivono di cose alle quali sono interessate, perciò molti argomenti non vengono coperti e le notizie di attualità sono trattate con molto dettaglio.",Italian
"Nell'edizione inglese di Wikipedia la voce sull'uragano Frances è lunga cinque volte quella sull'arte cinese, e la voce sulla soap opera Coronation Street è lunga il doppio di quella sul primo ministro inglese Tony Blair.» L'ex redattore capo di Nupedia, Larry Sanger, affermò nel 2004 che «quando si tratta di argomenti relativamente specializzati (al di fuori degli interessi di molti dei collaboratori), la credibilità del progetto è molto irregolare».",Italian
"Wikipedia è stata elogiata poiché, come wiki, permette alle voci di essere aggiornate o create in risposta ad avvenimenti di attualità.",Italian
"Per esempio, la voce sul maremoto dell'Oceano Indiano nella sua edizione inglese venne citata spesso dalla stampa poco dopo l'episodio.",Italian
"I suoi redattori hanno anche affermato che Wikipedia, come sito web è capace di includere voci su un più ampio numero di argomenti di quanto potrebbe fare un'enciclopedia stampata.",Italian
"La rivista di informatica tedesca c't nell'ottobre 2004 ha fatto un confronto tra le enciclopedie Brockhaus Premium, Microsoft Encarta e Wikipedia.",Italian
Degli esperti hanno valutato 66 voci in varie discipline.,Italian
"Nel punteggio complessivo, Wikipedia ha ottenuto 3,6 punti su 5, la Brockhaus Premium 3,3 e Microsoft Encarta 3,1.",Italian
"In un'analisi sulle enciclopedie online, i professori della Indiana University Emigh e Herring, hanno poi sostenuto che «Wikipedia apporta miglioramenti alle tradizionali fonti di informazione, specialmente per le aree in cui è forte, come tecnologia e avvenimenti d'attualità».",Italian
Alla fine del 2005 è sorta una controversia dopo che il giornalista John Seigenthaler Sr. aveva notato come la sua biografia fosse stata vandalizzata inserendo informazioni false.,Italian
Ciò ha portato alla decisione di restringere – nell'edizione di Wikipedia in inglese – la possibilità di creare nuove voci ai soli utenti registrati.,Italian
La rivista scientifica Nature nel 2005 riportava (anche in risposta al caso Seigenthaler) i risultati di uno studio comparato secondo cui le voci scientifiche in Wikipedia erano comparabili in accuratezza a quelle presenti nell'Enciclopedia Britannica (sull'edizione inglese di Wikipedia furono riscontrati una media di 4 errori per voce contro i 3 della Britannica).,Italian
"[46][47][48] La ricerca di Nature fece notevole scalpore nei media, dai quali è stata spesso citata come dimostrazione dell'efficacia dei progetti basati sul crowdsourcing.",Italian
"Secondo un nuovo studio condotto nel 2012 dalla società Epic e da alcuni ricercatori dell'università di Oxford, Wikipedia è divenuta più precisa, documentata e aggiornata rispetto alla Britannica.",Italian
"[49][50] Tra il 28 dicembre 2005 e il 10 gennaio 2006 l'edizione in lingua italiana di Wikipedia è stata sottoposta a un esperimento da parte del settimanale L'espresso, che ha inserito volutamente quattro errori in altrettante voci dell'enciclopedia (Álvaro Recoba, Ugo Foscolo, Giovanni Spadolini, Georg Hegel) e una voce del tutto inventata su un inesistente poeta di nome Carlo Zamolli.",Italian
La voce Álvaro Recoba è stata corretta in poco più di un'ora.,Italian
La voce Georg Hegel è stata corretta dopo dieci giorni.,Italian
Le altre due voci contenenti gli inserimenti errati e la voce inventata sono state corrette solo dopo l'uscita del settimanale nelle edicole.,Italian
"Come ulteriore esempio una voce intitolata Elia Spallanzani, del tutto inventata, inserita l'8 gennaio 2005 non è stata corretta fino al 19 maggio 2006: nel corso della procedura di cancellazione la voce è stata modificata in modo da chiarire che si trattava di una biografia immaginaria.",Italian
"Nel suo pamphlet sulla specializzazione, frammentazione e disgregazione del sapere,[51] Lucio Russo conclude: «Non è facile prevedere l'esito dell'esperimento sociologico-culturale di massa di Wikipedia, ma credo che in ogni caso questo tentativo di ricostruire dal basso uno strumento condivisibile di conoscenza, al quale stanno partecipando milioni di volontari di tutto il mondo, costituisca un'esperienza da cui non si potrà prescindere in futuro e autorizza qualche timida speranza.» Wikipedia ha vinto due premi importanti nel maggio 2004: il primo è stato un Golden Nica per le Comunità Digitali all'interno del Prix Ars Electronica di Linz in Austria[52], in cui annualmente sono consegnati premi nel campo dell'arte elettronica ed interattiva, dell'animazione al computer, della cultura digitale e della musica.",Italian
Questo premio fu accompagnato da un finanziamento di 10.000 euro e da un invito a presenziare al PAE Cyberarts Festival di quell'anno.,Italian
"Il secondo è stato un Webby Award (premio annuale per i migliori siti web) proposto dalla giuria per la categoria ""Comunità"".",Italian
"Wikipedia è anche stata nominata per il premio della categoria ""Migliori attività"".",Italian
Nel settembre 2004 l'edizione giapponese di Wikipedia ha ottenuto un Premio per la Creazione Web dalla Associazione Inserzionisti del Giappone.,Italian
"Questo premio, normalmente consegnato a singole persone che si sono distinte per il loro contributo al web in giapponese, è stato ritirato da un collaboratore di lunga data, per conto del progetto.",Italian
"Wikipedia ha ricevuto plausi da fonti giornalistiche quali BBC News, USA Today, The Economist, Newsweek, BusinessWeek, il Chicago Sun-Times, Time Magazine e Wired Magazine[senza fonte].",Italian
"A dicembre 2005 la Wikipedia in italiano ha ricevuto due premi nell'ambito del Premio WWW 2005, organizzato da Il Sole 24 Ore: Nell'edizione 2007 dello stesso premio si aggiudica la categoria Portali, siti di informazione & community.",Italian
[54] Nel 2009 il lancio di Wikipedia (avvenuto nel 2001) è stato inserito da Webby Awards nei 10 momenti più importanti per Internet nell'ultimo decennio (2000-2009).,Italian
[55] Wikipedia è riconosciuta dal Guinness World Records (Guinness dei primati) come la più grande enciclopedia online[56] e come la più grande enciclopedia in assoluto.,Italian
"[4] Altri progetti L’apprendimento automatico (nella letteratura di lingua anglosassone machine learning) è una branca dell'intelligenza artificiale che raccoglie metodi sviluppati negli ultimi decenni del XX secolo in varie comunità scientifiche, sotto diversi nomi quali: statistica computazionale, riconoscimento di pattern, reti neurali artificiali, filtraggio adattivo, teoria dei sistemi dinamici, elaborazione delle immagini, data mining, algoritmi adattivi, ecc; che utilizza metodi statistici per migliorare la performance di un algoritmo nell'identificare pattern nei dati.",Italian
"Nell'ambito dell'informatica, l'apprendimento automatico è una variante alla programmazione tradizionale nella quale in una macchina si predispone l'abilità di apprendere qualcosa dai dati in maniera autonoma, senza istruzioni esplicite[1][2].",Italian
"Arthur Samuel, che coniò il termine nel 1959[3], in linea di principio identifica due approcci distinti.",Italian
"Il primo metodo, indicato come rete neurale, sviluppa macchine ad apprendimento automatico per impiego generale il cui comportamento è appreso da una rete di commutazione connessa casualmente, a seguito di una routine di apprendimento basata su ricompensa e punizione (apprendimento per rinforzo).",Italian
"Il secondo metodo, più specifico, consiste nel riprodurre l'equivalente di una rete altamente organizzata progettata per imparare solo attività specifiche.",Italian
"La seconda procedura, che necessita di supervisione e richiede la riprogrammazione per ogni nuova applicazione, è molto più efficiente dal punto di vista computazionale.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico è strettamente legato al riconoscimento di pattern e alla teoria computazionale dell'apprendimento[4] ed esplora lo studio e la costruzione di algoritmi che possano apprendere da un insieme di dati e fare delle predizioni su questi,[5] costruendo in modo induttivo un modello basato su dei campioni.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico viene impiegato in quei campi dell'informatica nei quali progettare e programmare algoritmi espliciti è impraticabile; tra le possibili applicazioni citiamo il filtraggio delle email per evitare spam, l'individuazione di intrusioni in una rete o di intrusi che cercano di violare dati,[6] il riconoscimento ottico dei caratteri[7], i motori di ricerca e la visione artificiale.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico è collegato, e spesso si sovrappone, alla statistica computazionale, che si occupa dell'elaborazione di predizioni tramite l'uso di computer.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico è anche fortemente legato all'ottimizzazione matematica, che fornisce metodi, teorie e domini di applicazione a questo campo.",Italian
"Per usi commerciali, l'apprendimento automatico è conosciuto come analisi predittiva.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico si sviluppa con lo studio dell'intelligenza artificiale, e vi è strettamente collegato: infatti già dai primi tentativi di definire l'intelligenza artificiale come disciplina accademica, alcuni ricercatori si erano mostrati interessati alla possibilità che le macchine imparassero dai dati.",Italian
"Questi ricercatori, in particolare Marvin Minsky, Arthur Samuel e Frank Rosenblatt, provarono ad avvicinarsi al problema sia attraverso vari metodi formali, sia con quelle che vengono definite reti neurali nei tardi anni '50.",Italian
"Le reti neurali erano allora costituite da singoli percettroni e da modelli matematici derivati dal modello lineare generalizzato della statistica, come l'ADALINE di Widrow[8][9].",Italian
"Si provò a sfruttare anche ragionamenti probabilistici, in particolare nelle diagnosi mediche automatiche[10].",Italian
"Sempre negli anni '50, Alan Turing propose l'idea di una macchina che apprende, ovvero in grado di imparare e dunque diventare intelligente.",Italian
La proposta specifica di Turing anticipa gli algoritmi genetici[11].,Italian
"Tuttavia già dalla metà degli anni '50 lo studio dell'intelligenza artificiale si stava concentrando su approcci logici di tipo knowledge-based, nota oggi sotto il nome di GOFAI, causando un distacco tra lo studio dell'IA e quello dell'apprendimento automatico.",Italian
Sistemi di tipo probabilistico erano invasi di problemi sia teoretici sia pratici in termini di acquisizione e rappresentazione dei dati[10].,Italian
"Negli anni Ottanta, i sistemi esperti dominavano il campo dell'IA, e i sistemi basati sulla statistica non venivano più studiati[12].",Italian
"Lo studio dell'apprendimento simbolico e knowledge-based continuò nell'ambito dell'IA, portando a sviluppare la programmazione logica induttiva, ma ora la ricerca più prettamente statistica si svolgeva al di fuori del campo vero e proprio dell'intelligenza artificiale, nel riconoscimento di pattern e nell'information retrieval[10].",Italian
"Un altro motivo per cui lo studio dell'apprendimento automatico fu abbandonato fu la pubblicazione del libro Perceptrons: an introduction to computational geometry di Marvin Minsky e Seymour Papert, che vi descrivevano alcune delle limitazioni dei percettroni e delle reti neurali.",Italian
"La ricerca sulle reti neurali subì un significativo rallentamento a causa dell'interpretazione del libro, che le descriveva come intrinsecamente limitate[13][14].",Italian
"Anche la linea di ricerca sulle reti neurali continuò al di fuori del campo dell'IA, portata avanti da ricercatori provenienti da altre discipline quali Hopfield, Rumelhart, Hinton e Fukushima.",Italian
Il loro successo principale fu a metà degli anni '80 con la riscoperta della backpropagation[10] e della self-organization[15].,Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico, sviluppatosi come campo di studi separato dall'IA classica, cominciò a rifiorire negli anni '90.",Italian
Il suo obiettivo cambiò dall'ottenere l'intelligenza artificiale ad affrontare problemi risolvibili di natura pratica.,Italian
"Distolse inoltre la propria attenzione dagli approcci simbolici che aveva ereditato dall'IA, e si diresse verso metodi e modelli presi in prestito dalla statistica e dalla teoria della probabilità[12].",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico ha inoltre beneficiato dalla nascita di Internet, che ha reso l'informazione digitale più facilmente reperibile e distribuibile.",Italian
"Tom M. Mitchell ha fornito la definizione più citata di apprendimento automatico nel suo libro ""Machine Learning"": ""Si dice che un programma apprende dall'esperienza E con riferimento a alcune classi di compiti T e con misurazione della performance P, se le sue performance nel compito T, come misurato da P, migliorano con l'esperienza E.""[16] In poche parole, si potrebbe semplificare dicendo che un programma apprende se c'è un miglioramento delle prestazioni dopo un compito svolto.",Italian
"Questa definizione di Mitchell è rilevante poiché fornisce una definizione operativa dell'apprendimento automatico, invece che in termini cognitivi.",Italian
"Fornendo questa definizione, Mitchell di fatto segue la proposta che Alan Turing fece nel suo articolo ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", sostituendo la domanda ""Le macchine possono pensare?""",Italian
"con la domanda ""Le macchine possono fare quello che noi (in quanto entità pensanti) possiamo fare?""[17].",Italian
"L'obiettivo principe dell'apprendimento automatico è che una macchina sia in grado di generalizzare dalla propria esperienza[18], ossia che sia in grado di svolgere ragionamenti induttivi.",Italian
"In questo contesto, per generalizzazione si intende l'abilità di una macchina di portare a termine in maniera accurata esempi o compiti nuovi, che non ha mai affrontato, dopo aver fatto esperienza su un insieme di dati di apprendimento.",Italian
"Gli esempi di addestramento (in inglese chiamati training examples) si assume provengano da una qualche distribuzione di probabilità, generalmente sconosciuta e considerata rappresentativa dello spazio delle occorrenze del fenomeno da apprendere; la macchina ha il compito di costruire un modello probabilistico generale dello spazio delle occorrenze, in maniera tale da essere in grado di produrre previsioni sufficientemente accurate quando sottoposta a nuovi casi.",Italian
L'analisi computazionale degli algoritmi di apprendimento automatico e delle loro prestazioni è una branca dell'Informatica teorica chiamata teoria dell'apprendimento.,Italian
"Dato che gli esempi di addestramento sono insiemi finiti di dati e non c'è modo di sapere l'evoluzione futura di un modello, la teoria dell'apprendimento non offre alcuna garanzia sulle prestazioni degli algoritmi.",Italian
"D'altro canto, è piuttosto comune che tali prestazioni siano vincolate da limiti probabilistici.",Italian
Il bias-variance tradeoff è uno dei modi di quantificare l'errore di generalizzazione.,Italian
"Affinché la generalizzazione offra le migliori prestazioni possibili, la complessità dell'ipotesi induttiva deve essere pari alla complessità della funzione sottostante i dati.",Italian
"Se l'ipotesi è meno complessa della funzione, allora il modello manifesta underfitting.",Italian
"Quando la complessità del modello viene aumentata in risposta, allora l'errore di apprendimento diminuisce.",Italian
"Al contrario invece se l'ipotesi è troppo complessa, allora il modello manifesta overfitting e la generalizzazione sarà più scarsa[19].",Italian
"Oltre ai limiti di prestazioni, i teorici dell'apprendimento studiano la complessità temporale e la fattibilità dell'apprendimento stesso.",Italian
Una computazione è considerata fattibile se può essere svolta in tempo polinomiale.,Italian
"I compiti dell'apprendimento automatico vengono tipicamente classificati in tre ampie categorie, a seconda della natura del ""segnale"" utilizzato per l'apprendimento o del ""feedback"" disponibile al sistema di apprendimento.",Italian
"Queste categorie, anche dette paradigmi, sono:[10] A metà strada tra l'apprendimento supervisionato e quello non supervisionato c'è l'apprendimento semi-supervisionato, nel quale l'insegnante fornisce un dataset incompleto per l'allenamento, cioè un insieme di dati per l'allenamento tra i quali ci sono dati senza il rispettivo output desiderato.",Italian
"La trasduzione è un caso speciale di questo principio, nel quale l'intero insieme delle istanze del problema è noto durante l'apprendimento, eccetto la parte degli output desiderati che è mancante.",Italian
Un'altra categorizzazione dei compiti dell'apprendimento automatico si rileva quando si considera l'output desiderato del sistema di apprendimento automatico.,Italian
[20] L'apprendimento automatico e la statistica sono discipline strettamente collegate.,Italian
"Secondo Michael I. Jordan, le idee dell'apprendimento automatico, dai principi metodologici agli strumenti teorici, sono stati sviluppati prima in statistica[22].",Italian
Jordan ha anche suggerito il termine data science come nome con cui chiamare l'intero campo di studi[22].,Italian
"Leo Breiman ha distinto due paradigmi statistici di modellazione: modello basato sui dati e modello basato sugli algoritmi[23], dove ""modello basato sugli algoritmi"" indica approssimativamente algoritmi di apprendimento automatico come la foresta casuale.",Italian
"Alcuni statistici hanno adottato metodi provenienti dall'apprendimento automatico, il che ha portato alla creazione di una disciplina combinata chiamata ""apprendimento statistico""[24].",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico viene a volte unito al data mining,[25] che si focalizza maggiormente sull'analisi esplorativa dei dati ed utilizza principalmente il paradigma di apprendimento chiamato ""apprendimento non supervisionato""[26].",Italian
"Invece, l'apprendimento automatico può essere anche supervisionato[27].",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico e il data mining infatti si sovrappongono in modo significativo, ma mentre l'apprendimento automatico si concentra sulla previsione basata su proprietà note apprese dai dati, il data mining si concentra sulla scoperta di proprietà prima sconosciute nei dati.",Italian
"Il data mining sfrutta i metodi dell'apprendimento automatico, ma con obiettivi differenti; d'altro canto, l'apprendimento automatico utilizza i metodi di data mining come metodi di apprendimento non supervisionato o come passi di preprocessing per aumentare l'accuratezza dell'apprendimento.",Italian
"Gran parte della confusione tra le due comunità di ricerca scaturisce dall'assunzione di base del loro operato: nell'apprendimento automatico, le prestazioni sono generalmente valutate in base all'abilità di riprodurre conoscenza già acquisita, mentre in data mining il compito chiave è la scoperta di conoscenza che prima non si aveva.",Italian
L'apprendimento automatico ha legami molto stretti con l'ottimizzazione: molti problemi di apprendimento sono formulati come la minimizzazione di una qualche funzione di costo su un insieme di esempi di apprendimento.,Italian
La funzione di costo (o funzione di perdita) rappresenta la discrepanza tra le previsioni del modello che si sta addestrando e le istanze del problema reale.,Italian
"Le differenze tra i due campi (l'apprendimento automatico e l'ottimizzazione) sorgono dall'obiettivo della generalizzazione: mentre gli algoritmi di ottimizzazione possono minimizzare la perdita su un insieme di apprendimento, l'apprendimento automatico si preoccupa di minimizzare la perdita su campioni mai visti dalla macchina[28].",Italian
"La risoluzione automatica di problemi avviene, nel campo dell'informatica, in due modi differenti: tramite paradigmi di hard computing o tramite paradigmi di soft computing.",Italian
Per hard computing si intende la risoluzione di un problema tramite l'esecuzione di un algoritmo ben definito e decidibile.,Italian
"La maggior parte dei paradigmi di hard computing sono metodi ormai consolidati, ma presentano alcuni lati negativi: infatti richiedono sempre un modello analitico preciso e definibile, e spesso un alto tempo di computazione.",Italian
"Le tecniche di soft computing d'altro canto antepongono il guadagno nella comprensione del comportamento di un sistema a scapito della precisione, spesso non necessaria.",Italian
I paradigmi di soft computing si basano su due principi[29]: L'apprendimento automatico si avvale delle tecniche di soft computing.,Italian
"La programmazione logica induttiva (anche ILP, dall'inglese inductive logic programming) è un approccio all'apprendimento di regole che usa la programmazione logica come rappresentazione uniforme per gli esempi di input, per la conoscenza di base della macchina, e per le ipotesi.",Italian
"Data una codifica della (nota) conoscenza di base e un insieme di esempi rappresentati come fatti in una base di dati logica, un sistema ILP deriva un programma logico ipotetico da cui conseguono tutti gli esempi positivi, e nessuno di quelli negativi.",Italian
"La programmazione induttiva è un campo simile che considera ogni tipo di linguaggio di programmazione per rappresentare le ipotesi invece che soltanto la programmazione logica, come ad esempio programmi funzionali.",Italian
L'albero di decisione è un metodo di apprendimento per approssimazione di una funzione obiettivo discreta in cui l'elemento che apprende è rappresentato da un albero di decisione.,Italian
Gli alberi di decisione possono essere rappresentati da un insieme di regole if-else per migliorare la leggibilità umana.,Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico basato su regole di associazione è un metodo di apprendimento che identifica, apprende ed evolve delle ""regole"" con l'intento di immagazzinare, manipolare e applicare conoscenza.",Italian
La caratteristica principale di questo tipo di apprendimento è l'identificazione ed utilizzo di un insieme di regole relazionali che rappresenta nel suo insieme la conoscenza catturata dal sistema.,Italian
Ciò si pone in controtendenza con altri tipi di apprendimento automatico che normalmente identificano un singolo modello che può essere applicato universalmente ad ogni istanza per riuscire a fare su di essa una previsione[30].,Italian
Gli approcci dell'apprendimento basato su regole di associazione includono il sistema immunitario artificiale.,Italian
Una rete neurale artificiale è un sistema adattivo che cambia la sua struttura basata su informazioni esterne o interne che scorrono attraverso la rete durante la fase di apprendimento.,Italian
In termini pratici le reti neurali sono strutture non-lineari di dati statistici organizzate come strumenti di modellazione.,Italian
Esse possono essere utilizzate per simulare relazioni complesse tra ingressi e uscite che altre funzioni analitiche non riescono a rappresentare.,Italian
Inoltre esse sono robuste agli errori presenti nel training data.,Italian
Gli algoritmi genetici forniscono un approccio all'apprendimento che è liberamente ispirato all'evoluzione simulata.,Italian
La ricerca di una soluzione del problema inizia con una popolazione di soluzioni iniziale.,Italian
"I membri della popolazione attuale danno luogo a una popolazione di nuova generazione per mezzo di operazioni quali la mutazione casuale e crossover, che sono modellati sui processi di evoluzione biologica.",Italian
"Ad ogni passo, le soluzioni della popolazione attuale sono valutate rispetto a una determinata misura di fitness, con le ipotesi più adatte selezionate probabilisticamente come semi per la produzione della prossima generazione.",Italian
Gli algoritmi genetici sono stati applicati con successo a una varietà di compiti di apprendimento e di altri problemi di ottimizzazione.,Italian
"Ad esempio, essi sono stati usati per imparare raccolte di norme per il controllo del robot e per ottimizzare la topologia dei parametri di apprendimento per reti neurali artificiali.",Italian
Il ragionamento bayesiano fornisce un approccio probabilistico di inferenza.,Italian
Esso si basa sul presupposto che le quantità di interesse sono disciplinate da distribuzioni di probabilità e che le decisioni ottimali possono essere prese a seguito dell'analisi di queste probabilità insieme ai dati osservati.,Italian
"Nell'ambito dell'apprendimento automatico, la teoria Bayesiana è importante perché fornisce un approccio quantitativo per valutare le prove a sostegno dell'ipotesi alternativa.",Italian
Il Ragionamento bayesiano fornisce la base per l'apprendimento negli algoritmi che manipolano direttamente le probabilità.,Italian
"Macchine a vettori di supporto (Support Vector Machine, SVM) sono un insieme di metodi di apprendimento supervisionato usati per la classificazione e la regressione di pattern.",Italian
"Dato un insieme di esempi di addestramento, ciascuno contrassegnato come appartenente a due possibili categorie, un algoritmo di addestramento SVM costruisce un modello in grado di prevedere a quale categoria deve appartenere un nuovo esempio di input.",Italian
"La discesa dei prezzi per l'hardware e lo sviluppo di GPU per uso personale negli ultimi anni hanno contribuito allo sviluppo del concetto di apprendimento profondo, che consiste nello sviluppare livelli nascosti multipli nelle reti neurali artificiali.",Italian
Questo approccio tenta di modellizzare il modo in cui il cervello umano processa luce e suoni e li interpreta in vista e udito.,Italian
Alcune delle applicazioni più affermate dell'apprendimento profondo sono la visione artificiale e il riconoscimento vocale[31].,Italian
"La cluster analisi, o clustering, è in grado di rilevare similarità strutturali tra le osservazioni di un dataset attraverso l'assegnazione di un insieme di osservazioni in sottogruppi (cluster) di elementi tra loro omogenei[1].",Italian
"Il clustering è un metodo di apprendimento non supervisionato, e una tecnica comune per l'analisi statistica dei dati.",Italian
Tutti i sistemi di riconoscimento vocale di maggior successo utilizzano metodi di apprendimento automatico.,Italian
"Ad esempio, il SPHINXsystem[32] impara le strategie di altoparlanti specifici per riconoscere i suoni primitivi (fonemi) e le parole del segnale vocale osservato.",Italian
"Metodi di apprendimento basati su reti neurali e su modelli di Markov nascosti sono efficaci per la personalizzazione automatica di vocabolari, caratteristiche del microfono, rumore di fondo, ecc.",Italian
Metodi di apprendimento automatico sono stati usati per addestrare i veicoli controllati da computer.,Italian
"Ad esempio, il sistema ALVINN[33] ha usato le sue strategie per imparare a guidare senza assistenza a 70 miglia all'ora per 90 miglia su strade pubbliche, tra le altre auto.",Italian
Con tecniche simili sono possibili applicazioni in molti problemi di controllo basato su sensori.,Italian
Metodi di apprendimento automatico sono stati applicati ad una varietà di banche dati di grandi dimensioni per imparare regolarità generali implicite nei dati.,Italian
"Ad esempio, algoritmi di apprendimento basati su alberi di decisione sono stati usati dalla NASA per classificare oggetti celesti a partire dal secondo Palomar Observatory Sky Survey[34].",Italian
"Questo sistema è oggi utilizzato per classificare automaticamente tutti gli oggetti nel Sky Survey, che si compone di tre terabyte di dati immagine.",Italian
I programmi per computer di maggior successo per il gioco del backgammon sono basati su algoritmi di apprendimento.,Italian
"Ad esempio, il miglior programma di computer al mondo per backgammon, TD-Gammon[35], ha sviluppato la sua strategia giocando oltre un milione di partite di prova contro se stesso.",Italian
Tecniche simili hanno applicazioni in molti problemi pratici in cui gli spazi di ricerca molto rilevanti devono essere esaminati in modo efficiente.,Italian
L'apprendimento automatico solleva un numero di problematiche etiche.,Italian
I sistemi addestrati con insiemi di dati faziosi o pregiudizievoli possono esibire questi pregiudizi quando vengono interpellati: in questo modo possono essere digitalizzati pregiudizi culturali quali il razzismo istituzionale e il classismo[36].,Italian
Di conseguenza la raccolta responsabile dei dati può diventare un aspetto critico dell'apprendimento automatico.,Italian
"In ragione dell'innata ambiguità dei linguaggi naturali, le macchine addestrate su corpi linguistici necessariamente apprenderanno questa ambiguità[37].",Italian
"Altri progetti 
.stiamo tutti cercando modi rapidi per diventare più fluenti in inglese lo so capisco quello che succede è che ci sono solo poche parole che circondano il nostro cervello e abbiamo bisogno di rendere l'intera conversazione usando semplicemente fantastico, fantastico o epico, quindi che ne dici di noi impara alcune nuove parole inglesi intelligenti che puoi usare nella tua vita quotidiana e migliora il tuo vocabolario in pochi minuti.",Italian
"quindi oggi impareremo 10 nuove parole intelligenti, i loro significati, parole di base e frasi di esempio, quindi andiamo avanti ehi tutti, questo è e state guardando.",Italian
e in questo video ti darò 10 parole intelligenti per l'uso quotidiano e alla fine di questo video.,Italian
Ti darò anche un consiglio intelligente per suonare un numero di parole intelligenti davvero fluente.,Italian
uno è sommerso palude significa annegamento o inondazione ma palude è spesso usato nel contesto del lavoro come i ' Sono sommerso dal lavoro Ho troppo lavoro da fare Sono stato sommerso dal lavoro per tutta la settimana Ho avuto a malapena il tempo di respirare ora diamo un'occhiata alla radice di questa parola.,Italian
"palude è un pezzo di zona umida e se qualcuno cammina nel posto sbagliato su una palude potrebbe facilmente annegare e la forma verbale di palude significa affondare, quindi ecco come puoi usare questa parola.",Italian
diciamo che hai molti incarichi e hai un test in arrivo e i tuoi amici vengono da te e dicono.,Italian
hey perché non esci con noi puoi dire loro che mi dispiace ma sono sommerso dal lavoro o sono sommerso alcune altre parole che puoi usare al posto di sommerso se ho troppo fare.,Italian
ci sono troppe cose nel mio piatto che sto affogando nel lavoro.,Italian
"sono sommerso da incarichi, la parola intelligente numero due è catch-22 ora sono sicuro che tu ' Ho sentito questa parola prima di catch-22 significa una situazione impossibile in cui non puoi fare una cosa a meno che tu non abbia fatto l'altra e non puoi fare l'altra perché non hai fatto la prima.",Italian
"ti ho confuso, quindi lascia che ti faccia alcuni esempi una situazione di cattura è quando non ottieni un lavoro senza avere esperienza lavorativa.",Italian
ma non puoi fare esperienza finché non ottieni un lavoro catch-22 è stato coniato da joseph heller nel suo famoso libro con lo stesso nome catch-22 quando descriveva alcune regole contraddittorie che erano applicabili ai soldati durante la seconda guerra mondiale.,Italian
un altro esempio di catch-22 è che hai bisogno di un prestito bancario perché non ne hai abbastanza.,Italian
"soldi ma non otterresti quel prestito bancario a meno che non provi alla banca che hai abbastanza soldi, quindi la prossima volta che sei bloccato in una situazione difficile ricorda.",Italian
per usare la parola catch-22.,Italian
e ottieni questi sguardi ammirati dai tuoi amici altre parole che puoi usare al posto di catch-22 sono paradosso o dilemma parola intelligente.,Italian
il numero tre è soave soave soave significa essere sofisticato per essere educato in bilico e cool.,Italian
ben educato la parola suave ha diverse origini ma un'origine molto interessante della parola è che significa esempio di degustazione piacevole o dolce.,Italian
è così equilibrato e soave soprattutto di fronte alle signore o Barack Obama è così gentile e raffinato ora ricorda quando sei a una festa la prossima volta e vedi questa persona che è così.,Italian
"educato, colto e sofisticato.",Italian
non dimenticare di dire ehi chi è quel ragazzo soave là fuori nell'angolo che usa questa parola renderà immediatamente il tuo vocabolario.,Italian
molto soave così intelligente la parola numero quattro è atroce atroce la parola atroce significa qualcosa di veramente brutto orribile terribile crudele spaventoso offensivo atroce ha una radice latina chiamata .che significa paura crudele o terribile alcuni esempi della parola atroce sono i recenti episodi di stupro a Delhi sono stati atroci o vengono curati i prigionieri.,Italian
in modo atroce a volte nelle carceri atroce è usato anche nella vita di tutti i giorni per parlare di qualche malefatta comune e si vuole esagerare.,Italian
per esempio le sue maniere a tavola erano atroci o il suo senso dell'abbigliamento è così atroce o la sua grammatica è atroce.,Italian
quindi la prossima volta che sentirai parlare di un atto orribile al telegiornale ricordati di farlo.,Italian
"osserva e dì che questo è un atto atroce, la parola intelligente numero 5 è stupenda, stupenda, stupenda, significa stupefacente, stupefacente.",Italian
"ora usiamo spesso la parola fantastico qui ' È un'altra parola che puoi usare al posto di fantastico stupendo per esempio oggi ho ottenuto un punteggio stupendo nel mio test, il che significa che ho ottenuto un punteggio molto alto o. ho ottenuto un punteggio quasi perfetto, la parola stupendo ha radici latine classiche dalla parola che significa.",Italian
essere sbalordito così stupendo è usato per descrivere qualcosa che è straordinariamente buono per esempio lei sembra stupenda con quel vestito o che vista stupenda da questo balcone o sto leggendo questo libro stupendo che non riesco a mettere giù e tu vai e raccontare.,Italian
i tuoi amici che è questo stupendo canale per studenti e alcune altre parole che puoi usare invece di stupendi sono incredibilmente fantastici o eccezionalmente bravi ok quindi prima di continuare con le cinque parole equilibrate in questo video ricordati di mettere un commento sotto questo video.,Italian
per dirmi quale di queste dieci parole era la tua parola intelligente preferita numero sei è in una soluzione in una soluzione significa essere in una situazione problematica per esempio ragazzo sono in una situazione perché ho fatto piani con due amici diversi per questo sera.,Italian
Ho perso il telefono e sono in difficoltà o il nostro autobus si è rotto stamattina e io sono in difficoltà il mio amico si rivolge sempre a me per chiedere aiuto quando è in difficoltà e quando va bene se ne dimentica.,Italian
"così la prossima volta che prendi i compiti di matematica a scuola, ad esempio, e se hai lasciato il tuo libro di matematica a scuola, puoi dire ai tuoi amici che sei in un vero problema ora potresti pensare che la parola aggiustare abbia qualcosa da fare con la riparazione di qualcosa.",Italian
ma no in una soluzione significa essere in una situazione problematica altre parole che puoi usare invece che in una correzione sono io sono in una zuppa o io Sono in un pasticcio o sono in un punto di fastidio o semplicemente sono in un posto La parola intelligente numero 7 è flummox flummox significa confondere qualcuno.,Italian
"così tanto che dimenticano cosa fare ora confuso tende ad essere una parola abusata quindi invece di quello perché non usi flummox, ad esempio il ragazzo sembrava completamente sconcertato quando l'insegnante gli faceva una domanda in classe o il cane era sconcertato guardando al proprio riflesso nello specchio o il turista era sconcertato dalle diverse usanze che.",Italian
"ha incontrato durante i suoi viaggi o in un colloquio quando le è stato chiesto perché dovremmo assumerti, sembrava completamente sconcertata, quindi la prossima volta se ti confondi su qualsiasi domanda, ad esempio in un esame, allora tu.",Italian
posso sempre dirlo perché non avevo Sono stato preparato molto bene per l'esame sono rimasto sconcertato da alcune delle domande altre parole che puoi usare invece di sconcertato sono perplesso perplesso o perplesso La parola intelligente numero otto è rendezvous rendezvous rendezvous.,Italian
"è un modo molto francese di dire appuntamento o appuntamento, ad esempio ho un appuntamento con i miei amici a pranzo di sabato o ho intenzione di incontrarmi con i miei amici al centro commerciale per i film rendezvous può essere usato sia come sostantivo che come verbo per esempio.",Italian
ho un appuntamento con i miei amici stasera o domani ci incontrerò con i miei amici.,Italian
"in Francia il rendezvous precedente era usato dall'esercito per indicare un luogo di incontro per le truppe, ora c'è qualcosa di leggermente eccitante e segreto nella parola rendezvous anche adesso, quindi puoi usare rendezvous per qualsiasi riunione.",Italian
"in generale ma ha vinto ' Non è molto appropriato per un incontro ufficiale, quindi se hai un appuntamento forse puoi sicuramente dire che una parola intelligente rendezvous numero 9 è ottuso ottuso ottuso è un insulto che useresti quando stai cercando di chiamare qualcuno stupido o non intelligente.",Italian
o ottuso ora hai sentito la parola ottuso in geometria angolo ottuso e angolo acuto quindi un angolo ottuso è un angolo maggiore di 90 gradi ma inferiore a 180 gradi.,Italian
e un angolo acuto è questo angolo acuto inferiore a 90 gradi così acuto come una parola è usata per denotare acuto e quindi anche mentalmente acuto e ottuso denota smussato e quindi anche un po 'lento nella mente quindi frasi di esempio con ottuso sono l'uomo era così ottuso che ha dato via la sua password a un falso chiamante o al bambino ottuso.,Italian
non era in grado.,Italian
per rispondere a una singola domanda sul test o l'uomo ottuso ha avuto difficoltà a capire anche le istruzioni di base ora supponiamo che nella tua situazione nella vita quotidiana il tuo ragazzo o la tua ragazza sia arrabbiato con te e non sai perché così puoi.,Italian
"dì loro che forse sono ottuso ma non so perché sei così arrabbiato, la parola intelligente numero 10 è pigro pigro significa pigro per muoversi in modo lento per essere un po 'più lento.",Italian
del solito a sembrare un po 'stanco e mancante.,Italian
nell'esempio energetico un pranzo pesante mi rende molto pigro nel pomeriggio ha radici dalla parola che significa una persona lenta e una lumaca è un animale che si muove molto lentamente come una lumaca esempi.,Italian
l'economia è stata molto fiacca quest'anno o la partita è ripresa dopo un inizio fiacco.,Italian
"o gli affari sono stati lenti in questo trimestre, puoi usarli nella tua vita quotidiana se ti senti molto stanco un giorno puoi dirlo a tua madre o puoi dirlo.",Italian
i tuoi amici mi sento molto pigro.,Italian
oggi potrei fare con una bevanda energetica altre parole che puoi usare al posto di pigro potrebbero essere letargiche o trascinare i miei piedi quindi quelle erano le 10 parole intelligenti e prima.,Italian
"ti do quel consiglio segreto per sembrare molto fluente, voglio ricordarti che nel caso tu stia cercando parole intelligenti da usare in una telefonata, sto inserendo un collegamento a un video.",Italian
giù nella casella della descrizione per questo e ora il consiglio segreto il consiglio segreto per sembrare fluente è usare non più di una parola o frase intelligente che conosco a volte.,Italian
ci emozioniamo molto perché.,Italian
noi' ho imparato un sacco di queste parole intelligenti e tendiamo a racchiuderne due tre quattro in una frase che non suona naturale.,Italian
quindi uno alla volta assicurati di pronunciare .la parola nel modo giusto vai su google e digita la parola e nella ricerca in alto vedrai una piccola icona di un altoparlante fare clic su quell'altoparlante.,Italian
e ascolta la pronuncia una o due volte.,Italian
e sei pronto per partire e se questo video ti è piaciuto non dimenticare di darci un pollice in su con un commento.,Italian
per me sotto dicendomi quale di queste 10 parole qual è la tua preferita e anche.,Italian
se non hai già premuto il pulsante di iscrizione e l'icona della campana accanto ad esso e buona visione.,Italian

"questo è il miglior video con cui iniziare, quindi andiamo a 50 frasi in inglese in 10 minuti, si spera.",Italian
frase numero uno questo è un altro modo per chiedere.,Italian
come va?,Italian
come va?,Italian
Come va?.,Italian
quindi incontri qualcuno e il tempo come va ?.,Italian
"la frase numero due quando non vedi qualcuno da un po 'gli dici da molto tempo di non vederla, quindi significa che non hai visto questa persona forse settimane o mesi da molto tempo la frase non ci vediamo.",Italian
tre se vuoi chiederti cosa stavi facendo.,Italian
chiedi cosa stavi facendo quindi cosa stava succedendo nella tua vita?,Italian
cosa hai fatto per crescerli prima se tutto sta andando?,Italian
"beh, puoi semplicemente rispondere non puoi lamentarti, tutto è davvero fantastico.",Italian
"Non puoi lamentarti della prossima frase che qualcuno ti dice qualcosa e tu non l'hai davvero menzionato nella conversazione come se in qualche modo immaginassero che hai un nuovo lavoro, e glielo chiedi.",Italian
come fai a sapere?.,Italian
dove hai preso le notizie come come fai.,Italian
sappi che se qualcuno racconta una bella barzelletta puoi dire che è buona.,Italian
è un grande scherzo quindi la frase è buona.,Italian
"se vuoi ringraziare qualcuno puoi dire che è molto gentile da parte tua, grazie mille per averlo fatto, è molto gentile da parte tua, è molto gentile da parte tua se qualcuno.",Italian
"stava cercando di aiutarti, ma non è riuscito a raggiungere il risultato che puoi dire.",Italian
"grazie comunque non importa, ma grazie comunque.",Italian
grazie per l'impegno.,Italian
"no grazie comunque, e un'altra frase che uso nella mia email a volte quando non ho chiesto una persona.",Italian
chiedo e poi dico alla fine.,Italian
"grazie in anticipo, il che significa che spero davvero che lo farai.",Italian
fallo un po 'ringraziandoti in anticipo.,Italian
"grazie in anticipo se qualcuno ha commesso un errore, e ne è davvero arrabbiato.",Italian
puoi solo dire niente preoccupazioni.,Italian
"non preoccuparti, non preoccuparti, il che significa che non preoccuparti.",Italian
va bene.,Italian
"non preoccuparti, immagina di essere tornato a casa e ci sono tutti i tuoi amici seduti sul tuo divano.",Italian
e tu sei come quello che sta succedendo qui come quello che ci fai qui ?.,Italian
cosa succede se non hai notato qualcosa o non ha capito la persona a cui puoi sempre chiedere ti ho capito bene?,Italian
"e poi vai avanti e spiega dove sei, ti ho capito bene?",Italian
se chiedi a qualcuno di non essere arrabbiato di non piangere puoi dire di non prenderlo a cuore.,Italian
non prenderlo a cuore come sul serio non essere così arrabbiato non prenderlo a cuore.,Italian
un altro modo per chiedere se non hai colto una parte di una frase puoi dire che non ho colto l'ultima parola.,Italian
Mi dispiace.,Italian
puoi ripeterlo perché non ho colto l'ultima parola se vuole che qualcuno ripeta di nuovo l'intera frase.,Italian
puoi chiedere scusa.,Italian
Non stavo ascoltando perché forse eri occupato.,Italian
"forse stavi parlando al telefono e qualcuno stava parlando con te, e tu sei tipo.",Italian
Dio mio.,Italian
scusa non stavo ascoltando.,Italian
Puoi ripeterlo?.,Italian
Mi dispiace.,Italian
Non stavo ascoltando un'altra frase che uso sempre.,Italian
"non importa, non preoccuparti se mi fai cadere addosso il tuo caffè.",Italian
è come se non importasse.,Italian
Starò bene.,Italian
io' Vado comunque in lavanderia.,Italian
non importa se vuoi augurare buona fortuna a qualcuno.,Italian
e lo faccio sempre tu puoi dire dita incrociate e tu incroci le dita in quel modo.,Italian
dita incrociate.,Italian
"un'altra frase che gli americani usano è oh male che lo spiega e. la situazione è che non hai ottenuto qualcosa e poi ottieni un effetto extra, e lo ottieni.",Italian
e tu sei come oh quello che lo spiega quello che lo spiega.,Italian
un altro modo per dire alla persona di non essere arrabbiata è che puoi dire che le cose accadono come se andasse bene.,Italian
le cose succedono non essere turbato se non hai il nome di una persona con cui vuoi parlare.,Italian
puoi chiedere scusa per il disturbo che sai di vedere.,Italian
qualcuno è impegnato puoi sempre chiedere scusa per il disturbo e poi puoi andare avanti e chiedere.,Italian
mi dispiace disturbarti.,Italian
se sei nel mezzo di qualcosa in qualcuno ' ti sta chiedendo qualcosa che puoi dire oh.,Italian
"sei nel bel mezzo di qualcosa e qualcuno qualcuno ti sta chiedendo di fare qualcosa che dici, mi dispiace.",Italian
sarò con te tra un minuto sarò con te dentro e poi riprendi a fare qualcosa e dici dove eravamo.,Italian
come quando ci siamo fermati dov'eravamo e devi ripeterlo perché qual è il suono con cui qualcuno sbaglia.,Italian
quindi questo è un ottimo modo per esercitarsi a dove eravamo di nuovo se sei nel mezzo di una conversazione?,Italian
e non hai capito quello che diceva l'altra persona puoi dire che stavi dicendo e con un punto interrogativo.,Italian
che significa che spinge la persona a ripetere ancora una volta?,Italian
stavi dicendo .,Italian
se qualcuno ha un lavoro dei suoi sogni su qualunque cosa tu possa dire fortunato tu o qualcuno è entrato all'università dei suoi sogni come fortunato te questo è un modo per congratularsi con la persona fortunata o semplicemente sottolineare che è fortunato fortunato te un altro modo per dire che sei davvero arrabbiato è dire che sono impazzito come se fossi così arrabbiato che.,Italian
impazzito è super arrabbiato.,Italian
"oh, questo è quasi un matto.",Italian
Ho dato di matto un'altra frase che i madrelingua usano è buona per te e questo potrebbe essere sia positivo che negativo quando dici che sono stato promosso e se dicono bene per te come congratulazioni ea volte se dici come se stessi lasciando questo posto.,Italian
"ti fanno bene, sarebbe meglio senza di te e questo è un significato negativo, quindi ascolta davvero l'intonazione.",Italian
se qualcosa ti sorprende puoi anche dire che mi stai prendendo in giro come oh mio dio.,Italian
"Non posso credere che mi prendi in giro per dire a qualcuno di sorridere e per essere felice puoi sempre dire rallegrati, rallegrati.",Italian
"se vuoi che qualcuno suoni come se stesse piangendo e lamentandosi di qualcosa che non sta succedendo puoi dire vieni io, puoi farlo io?",Italian
Dai.,Italian
puoi farlo puoi passare il toefl puoi passare il gmat lo prenderai dai.,Italian
"puoi farlo se qualcuno sta facendo davvero bene, puoi dire loro di continuare il buon lavoro continuare il buon lavoro come essere bravo come sei e continuare il buon lavoro continuare ad essere un'altra frase è colloquiale, e questo è ciò che gli americani dire.",Italian
"è acceso, il che significa che è incredibile che molti americani abbiano detto in California.",Italian
"oh è acceso e probabilmente l'hai sentito in canzoni che ' è acceso se qualcuno ha successo dopo i fallimenti, quindi puoi dire eccoti ti ho detto che ce la farai se qualcuno ti chiede se sei stanco e vuoi dire che non sei stanco per niente posso dire non un po 'nah.",Italian
voglio continuare non sono stanco non è quando qualcuno ti chiede se sei sicuro e sei abbastanza sicuro di poter dire che non c'è spazio per quello?,Italian
non c'è spazio per dubbi in america se vuoi mandare un sms a qualcuno o mandargli un messaggio che dici da testo a testo quindi ti mando un messaggio significa che ti manderò un messaggio tramite whatsapp o un telegramma o messenger di qualsiasi cosa usando mandarti un altro messaggio per rallegrare qualcuno e dirgli di non essere arrabbiato puoi dire che non ne vale la pena come perché stai piangendo?,Italian
non ne vale la pena.,Italian
sei molto meglio del problema su cui piangi ' Non vale le tue lacrime.,Italian
"non ne vale la pena, personalmente amo la frase you rock che significa che sei fantastico.",Italian
Dio mio.,Italian
tu sei forte?,Italian
"no, hai fatto un lavoro straordinario.",Italian
"se qualcuno non lavora molto bene e vuoi che lavori di più puoi dire che dovresti fare un miglio in più, il che significa che lavorare di più dovresti fare un miglio in più.",Italian
un altro modo per dire la stessa cosa che puoi dire intensifica il tuo gioco come lavorare di più lavorare meglio intensificare il tuo gioco.,Italian

"kocaman ve görkemli bir altın şatodan Narcisa, gördüğü tüm güzelliğe hayret etti o kadar çok zenginliği hak ettiğimi biliyordum, onu beğeneceğinizi biliyordum, burada en güzel elbiselerden en lezzetli yiyeceklere kadar bulacağınız her şeyi bulacaksınız.",Turkish
"Sarayımda yemeklerden iyi bahsetmişken, o yolculuktan sonra gerçekten acıktım Açlıktan ölüyorum, o lezzetli yiyeceklerden herhangi birini alabilir miyim elbette burada et kokulu melisa sana ne istersen alacak senin hakkında çok şey duydum seni zavallı canım açsın değil mi gelip yemek masasına gidelim ve Sana biraz yiyecek alacağım, teşekkür ederim yemek odasına gittiler ve masanın üzerinde narcisa'nın şimdiye kadar gördüğü en şaşırtıcı yiyecekler vardı, çünkü reçel yapılır.",Turkish
"Yakutların zümrüt salataları ve oradaki ekmek altın altın ekmekten yapılmıştır Bu reçel, bir dilim aldığı ekmekle ne kadar güzel görünecek ve tadı güzel olacaktır.",Turkish
"Üzerine yakut reçeli ve kocaman bir ısırık aldım, bu çok sıcak, bu kadar iyi yiyemiyorum, altından yapılmış ekmek ve en iyisi de ama yiyemiyorsan sana gümüş ekmek gümüş alayım, neden olmasın sen ye.",Turkish
"başka bir şey ama yiyebileceğim normal ekmek ekmeği istiyorum, bu yüzden benim efendim kabuğumun müstakbel karısı soğuk, sadece tüm yiyeceklere baktığım en iyi narcisini yemelisin.",Turkish
"ama yenmez olan her şey için kalbi kırıldı, yakında ağlamaya başladı bunu istemiyorum ama yemek gerçekten çok iyi.",Turkish
"burada biraz altın patates deneyin, gerçekten çok iyiler ve benimle evlendikten sonra.",Turkish
"bunların hepsini yemek zorundasın, süslü şeyleri sevdiğini düşündüm hayır seninle evlenmek istemiyorum eve gitmek istiyorum.",Turkish
anneme eve gitmeme izin ver melissa ve terrence birbirlerine baktı ve güzelce göz kırptı.,Turkish
Eğer gerçekten istediğin buysa seni eve götürürüm terrence ağlayarak mutsuz olur.,Turkish
"narsis, arabanın içinde eve vardığında yaptığı seçimler hakkında derinlemesine düşünmeye başladı.",Turkish
evde oturan annesine sarılmak için koştu hüzünlü abla o tatlı kızım seni bir daha göremeyeceğimi sandım.,Turkish
"oh anne seni çok seviyorum ve haklıydın ve zenginlik her şey değil, ben onu yiyemediğim için altın ekmek faydasızdı ve adam olsa bile.",Turkish
"o yakışıklıydı, beni hiç umursamıyordu ama canım, başkalarına tam olarak böyle davrandığının farkında mısın, biliyorum, davranış şeklim için çok üzgünüm anne oh hayır, gördüğünden beri sorun değil.",Turkish
hatan ne oldu o günden itibaren sana güzel bir şeyler besleyelim.,Turkish
narcisa ilk başta mücadele ettiği yollarını değiştirdi ama yavaşça ve sabırla bir gün çok daha güzel olmaya başladı mellie ve terry tekrar marian ile buluşmaya geldi oh merhaba ikiniz o yüzden anlat bize marian.,Turkish
Nasıl' narsisizm artık marian onlara hem olan her şeyi anlattı hem de o zamandan beri çok değişti.,Turkish
"Artık altın ekmek istemeyeceğini mi tahmin ediyorum, ha biliyorsun.",Turkish
"terry sen aslında o meleğe biraz benziyorsun ama ne görüyorum, nasıl o olursun ikiniz çok hoşsunuz",Turkish
Nature  är en framstående brittisk vetenskaplig veckotidskrift som började utges 4 november 1869 och grundades av Norman Lockyer.,Sweedish
Den är världens mest citerade interdisciplinära vetenskapliga tidskrift.,Sweedish
[3] Fler än 1 700 artiklar har över åren författats av drygt 275 nobelpristagare.,Sweedish
[1] De flesta vetenskapliga tidskrifter är numera högt specialiserade men Nature är bland ett fåtal tidskrifter (veckotidskrifterna Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences är också framstående exempel) som fortfarande publicerar originalartiklar inom ett brett spektrum av vetenskapliga områden.,Sweedish
Det är många vetenskapliga områden inom vilka viktiga nya framsteg publiceras antingen i artikelform eller som brev i Nature.,Sweedish
Wikipedia (svenskt uttal: [vɪkɪ'peːdɪa]) är en wiki och en mångspråkig webbaserad encyklopedi.,Sweedish
"Den har i huvudsak fritt och öppet innehåll som utvecklas av sina användare, ofta benämnda wikipedianer.",Sweedish
[2] Den består till stor del av referat av källor skrivna av experter.,Sweedish
"Wikipedia lanserades den 15 januari 2001 av Jimmy Wales och Larry Sanger, ursprungligen i en engelskspråkig version, och är det mest besökta uppslagsverket på internet.",Sweedish
Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia startades den 23 maj 2001.,Sweedish
Wikipedia är (2020) rankad som världens trettonde och Sveriges åttonde mest besökta webbplats enligt Alexa.,Sweedish
[1] Wikipedia drivs av den icke-vinstinriktade stiftelsen Wikimedia Foundation med stöd av privata donatorer.,Sweedish
"Projektet bygger på wikiprogramvaran Mediawiki, som är uteslutande fri och har öppen källkod.",Sweedish
"Wikipedia grundades 15 januari 2001 av internetentreprenören Jimmy Wales och filosofen Larry Sanger, båda knutna till Wales internetföretag Bomis.",Sweedish
"De hade under år 2000 försökt starta uppslagsverket Nupedia, vilket dock begränsades av strikta krav på skribenterna.",Sweedish
"[3] Genom att använda wikitekniken, det vill säga en sökbar webbplats där sidorna enkelt och snabbt kan redigeras av besökarna, lyckades man få igång skrivandet.",Sweedish
"Wikipedia var från början enbart engelskspråkigt, men 15 mars 2001 togs initiativet till flera språk.",Sweedish
"[4] Först ut var tyska,[5] tätt följt av katalanska och japanska.",Sweedish
Dessa tre var i gång före utgången av mars.,Sweedish
Den 11 maj 2001 lades ytterligare nio stora språk till.,Sweedish
[6] Före utgången av 2001 fanns Wikipedia på 18 språk.,Sweedish
"Engelskspråkiga Wikipedia har hela tiden varit störst och hade i december 2019 5,9 miljoner artiklar.",Sweedish
Den första redigeringen gjordes av Bomis kontorskonto den 15 januari 2001 klockan 20:27 på sidan HomePage som då var namnet på förstasidan.,Sweedish
"Klockan 20:52 skapades den första artikeln, WikiPedia, av samma användare.",Sweedish
"Namnet ""wikipedia"" myntades av Larry Sanger[7] och är en sammanslagning av wiki, som är hawaiiska och betyder snabb[8] och encyclopedia, från grekiskans enkyklios paideia, ordagrant ""rundad bildning"" eller ""kunskaper som formar en krets"", i betydelsen ""allmänbildning"".[9].",Sweedish
"Svenska var det andra mindre språket (efter katalanska) som fick en egen Wikipedia, och första redigeringen gjordes 23 maj 2001 av Linus Tolke.",Sweedish
[10] Den äldsta bevarade startsidan[11] för Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia är från 10 juli 2001.,Sweedish
Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia var dock i stort sett inaktiv till november 2002.,Sweedish
Wikipedia finns idag tillgänglig på 317[12] olika språk.,Sweedish
"269 språkversioner hade i september 2020 över ettusen artiklar, och 30 språk hade då fler än en miljon artiklar.",Sweedish
"[13] Den engelskspråkiga versionen är störst, idag med 6 238 145 artiklar, 998 856 599 redigeringar sedan start och 141 020 aktiva bidragsgivare under den senaste månaden.",Sweedish
"[12] Därefter följde i september 2020 de cebuanospråkiga, svenskspråkiga, tyska, franska och nederländska versionerna, ordnade i storlek efter antal riktiga artiklar.",Sweedish
"[13] Totalt innehåller Wikipedias olika språkversioner just nu 228 586 156 artiklar, och den svenskspråkiga versionen har 3 431 103 artiklar.",Sweedish
"[12][a] Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia innefattar emellertid en stor andel (3,1 miljoner eller 81 procent, noterat januari 2019[14]) robotskapade artiklar och var i september 2020 bara på fjortonde plats sett till antal redigeringar sedan start och på tjugonde plats sett till antal aktiva inloggade bidragsgivare under senaste månaden.",Sweedish
"[13] Även cebuanospråkiga Wikipedia innefattar en mycket stor andel (5,3 miljoner eller 99,6 procent) robotskapade artiklar.",Sweedish
"[14] De flesta robotskapade artiklar har skapats av svenska Lsjbot, och handlar om djur eller ortnamn.",Sweedish
"[15] Många studenter, journalister, författare, forskare, med flera yrkeskategorier, hämtar dagligen uppgifter från Wikipedia, där snabbheten är en stor fördel jämfört med att leta i litteratur och forskningsartiklar.",Sweedish
Sökmotorer som Google leder ofta till Wikipedia och driver webbtrafik till Wikipedia.,Sweedish
Wikipediaartiklar anses emellertid främst användbara för att hitta andra mer auktoritativa källor snarare än som informationskälla till egna publikationer.,Sweedish
"[16] En svensk undersökning visade 2019 att 83 procent av de svenska internetanvändarna använde Wikipedia, varav tio procent gjorde det varje dag.",Sweedish
Bland de som studerar använde 94 procent Wikipedia för att söka information.,Sweedish
[17] Samma undersökning visade 2018 att i åldersgruppen upp till 45 år använde 90 procent Wikipedia.,Sweedish
Det var fler män än kvinnor som använde Wikipedia varje vecka: 45 procent män och 33 procent kvinnor.,Sweedish
"[18][19] Det finns ämnesorienterade Wikipediasidor som exemplifierar hur Wikipedia kan användas av släktforskare, av lärare och av vandrare.",Sweedish
"Det är vanligt förekommande att lärare, i synnerhet på universitetsnivå, avråder studenter från att använda Wikipedia som källa och istället rekommenderar att man går till de mer auktoritativa källor som i sin tur anges i många Wikipediaartiklar, därför att studenten med sitt val av källor ska bevisa uppsatsens akademiska nivå och vetenskapliga aktualitet.",Sweedish
Även Wikipedia rekommenderar att man använder verket för att hitta källor hellre än att uppge Wikipedia som källa.,Sweedish
"Andra lärare accepterar enstaka hänvisningar till Wikipedia eller andra uppslagsverk, om andra källor inte kan hittas, under förutsättning att längre uppsatser och examensrapporter inte i sin helhet är baserade på detta, utan grundas på forskningspublikationer, akademiska läroböcker och på studentens egna undersökning.",Sweedish
Wikipedia förekommer i princip aldrig i källhänvisningar i forskningspublikationer.,Sweedish
"Det förekommer att artiklar på Wikipedia listas bland kurslitteraturen för högskolekurser, bland annat i Sverige 2007, då dock med varnande noter för användning med viss försiktighet.",Sweedish
"[20] Forskare kan få fler forskningsciteringar om begrepp som de har myntat och teorier som de har lanserat refereras på Wikipedia, enligt nedan.",Sweedish
Wikipediaartiklar har mycket varierande kvalitet.,Sweedish
"Wikipediaartiklars trovärdighet vilar mycket på dess källor och på att ett stort antal personer bevakar, granskar och bidrar till artiklarna, medan andra uppslagsverk vilar på att dess författare är experter som anses vara auktoriteter på sina områden.",Sweedish
"En Wikipediaartikels tillförlitlighet kan bedömas bland annat genom att studera artikelns historik, som framgår av forskningsresultat nedan.",Sweedish
"En Wikipediaartikel som stämmer in på följande påståenden har således sannolikt hög trovärdighet: Dessa kriterier gör att den engelska språkversionen av Wikipedia (som har flest skribenter, flest artiklar och i allmänhet längre artiklar förutom om svenska förhållanden) bör ha fler trovärdiga artiklar än den svenska.",Sweedish
Detta är också en vanlig uppfattning bland svenska läsare.,Sweedish
[21] Också vanliga kriterier för källkritik kan tillämpas på Wikipediaartiklar.,Sweedish
"Det är tillåtet att direkt kopiera stora delar av artiklarna eller enstaka bilder till en egen publikation, förutsatt att man publicerar den under samma licens som Wikipedia, CC BY-SA (en bild kan ligga under annan öppen licens), och anger källa till artikeln så som licensen kräver.",Sweedish
"Publicerar man inte under fri licens krävs att man kommer överens med upphovspersonerna, exempelvis med en fotograf, om ersättning.",Sweedish
Referat av och korta citat från Wikipedia är tillåtna enligt citaträtten som från vilken som helst annan källa.,Sweedish
"Eftersom Wikipedia bygger på tidskriftsartiklar, forskningspublikationer och böcker finns risk för rundgång av felaktiga uppgifter, om professionella författare och skribenter slarvar med att uppge källa då de hämtar uppgifter från Wikipedia.",Sweedish
"Källhänvisning till Wikipedia måste vara tillräckligt exakt, så att läsare själv kan hitta artikeln och se artikelns författare i artikelhistoriken.",Sweedish
"Accessdatum är viktigt, eftersom Wikipediaartiklar förändras.",Sweedish
Källförteckningens källbeskrivning kan exempelvis utformas enligt följande om man använder Harvardsystemet som referenssystem:[22] Vid IEEE- och Vancouversystemet kan källbeskrivning formateras enligt följande (om källan är nummer 2 i källförteckningen): Enligt Oxfordsystemet kan samma källbeskrivning utformas: Alla versioner av sidorna på Wikipedia sparas.,Sweedish
Därmed är det möjligt att länka till just den version av en artikel man använt.,Sweedish
En länk till arkivversionen tillhandahålls i artiklarnas vänstermarginal.,Sweedish
Den funktionsprincip som ligger till grund för projektet kallas wiki (hawaiiska för snabbt).,Sweedish
"Wikiprincipen avser att det går snabbt att hitta artiklar, att det är enkelt att ändra och länka samman artiklar, att publiceringen inte fördröjs av redaktionell granskning och godkännande samt att det går snabbt att återställa ändringar till en tidigare version av artikeln.",Sweedish
"En wiki är en webbserver och databasserver som möjliggör för ett stort antal människor att tillsammans redigera webbsidor via webbgränssnitt, och innefattar funktioner för artikelhistorik och versionshantering.",Sweedish
En wiki har således stora likheter med ett webbpubliceringssystem.,Sweedish
"Viktiga skillnader är att i en wiki lagras sidorna i en icke-hierarkisk struktur, vilket underlättar sökning och länkning, samt att wikier traditionellt har saknat funktioner för att hantera linjeorganisationens arbetsflöden och beslutsgång för godkännande av publicering.",Sweedish
Wikipedia använder sig av den fria wikiprogramvaran MediaWiki som är licensierad under GNU General Public License (GPL).,Sweedish
"Från början använde Wikipedia en annan wikiprogramvara, UseModWiki, som också är licensierad under GPL.",Sweedish
"Serverklustren finns (sedan januari 2013) i delstaten Virginia och har även speglade data i casheservrar i datacenter i Amsterdam som bland annat betjänar Europa, i Singapore för Asien samt i San Francisco och Texas för Amerika.",Sweedish
"Tillsammans konsumerar de 2 GWh energi per år (år 2016), vilket motsvarar 700 tyska hushålls årsförbrukning.",Sweedish
"[23] Wikipedias webbsidor kan delas in i ett antal typer eller namnrymder, där de vanligaste är: För var och en av dessa sidor finns dessutom en diskussionssida, där främst sidans utformning (men inte dess ämne) diskuteras.",Sweedish
"Varje sida har en versionshistorik, där man ser vilken användaridentitet som har ändrat vad och när på sidan.",Sweedish
"Wikipedias artiklar redigeras vanligen genom att man använder wikikod (wikitext), som är ett kompakt märkspråk.",Sweedish
För nybörjare och andra som inte vill eller kan använda märkspråk finns sedan sommaren 2013 ett alternativt och enklare redigeringsgränssnitt – VisualEditor.,Sweedish
"[24] VisualEditor nås genom att välja fliken Redigera ovanför artikeln, medan wikikoden redigeras genom att välja Redigera wikitext.",Sweedish
"Båda metoderna kan användas för att wikifiera artikeln, det vill säga för att infoga länkar till andra artiklar, fotnoter, kategorier, bilder, rubriker, tabeller och annan typografisk formatering.",Sweedish
"Wikikod används även för att skapa mallar med innehåll som kan återanvändas i flera olika artiklar, och vars utformning kan anpassas med hjälp av olika parametrar.",Sweedish
"Mer komplicerad kodning av artiklar och mallar kan även göras i märkspråken html (för avancerad layout) och TeX (för matematiska formler och notskrift) samt programspråket Lua (för att skapa programmoduler som kan användas i avancerade mallar, och som körs på Mediawikiservern).",Sweedish
"Inloggade användare kan anpassa sitt användargränssnitt genom att välja mellan olika skal (stilmallar), och genom att aktivera olika finesser (program skrivna i språket Javascript).",Sweedish
Finesser lagras på Mediawikiservern men körs lokalt i användarens webbläsare.,Sweedish
Mediawikiprogramvaran är skriven i PHP.,Sweedish
"Bilder och andra mediafiler lagras i allmänhet i filarkivet Wikimedia Commons, som är gemensam för alla Wikimedia-projekten, och kan användas också av utomstående.",Sweedish
"En del projekt, såsom finsk- och engelskspråkiga Wikipedia, har dessutom egna filer som inte kan användas i andra projekt; medan innehåll på Commons förutsätts vara fritt, tillåts i dessa projekt även proprietär media på basen av fair use (återgivningsrätt).",Sweedish
Länkar mellan språkversionerna (språklänkar eller interwikilänkar) lagras sedan 2013 centralt på databasen Wikidata istället för att läggas in med wikikod i varje språkversion av varje artikel.,Sweedish
"På Wikidata kan även siffror, namn och annan kvantitativ data (motsats till löpande text) lagras gemensamt för alla språkversioner.",Sweedish
Data som är gemensamma för många språkversioner behöver på så sätt bara uppdateras på ett ställe.,Sweedish
Data från wikidata länkas automatiskt in i allt fler av Wikipedias faktarutor.,Sweedish
"Visionen är att även listor, tabeller, diagram och kartor ska kunna skapas automatiskt för olika språk, något som emellertid kräver komplicerad programmering i sökverktyg som SPARQL(en)[25] och Quarry[26].",Sweedish
"Ett enklare alternativ kan vara att lagra en tabelldatafil, exempelvis från ett kalkylark, på en sida i Wikimedia Commons datanamnrymd, vilket underlättar automatiskt skapande av diagram och kartor på olika språk.",Sweedish
[27][28][29] Wikidata är dessutom utformad för att vara en del av den semantiska webben.,Sweedish
"Syftet är att underlätta för maskiner (exempelvis kalkylprogram, artificiell intelligens och bottar) att söka, tolka, analysera, visualisera och uppdatera data i Wikidata.",Sweedish
"Wikidata lagrar därför data på ett strukturerat sätt, tillsammans med semantisk information som beskriver datats betydelse och relationer (Exempel: Stockholm -> är en instans av -> huvudstad, Stockholm -> tillhör den administrativa enheten -> Stockholms län, Stockholm -> grundades -> 1187).",Sweedish
"[30] Wikipedias ursprungliga användargränssnitt kallas dess stationära vy och är utformat för webbläsare på persondatorer, exempelvis stationära datorer, med relativt stora skärmar.",Sweedish
Idag kan Wikipediasidor även läsas och redigeras från handhållna enheter såsom mobiltelefoner.,Sweedish
Redan 2004 möjliggjorde Wapediatjänsten tillgång från mobiltelefoner via så kallade WAP-sidor (webbliknande teknik avsedd för mobiltelefoner med piltangenter och små skärmar).,Sweedish
År 2006[31] och 2007 lanserades mobilanpassade Wikipedia-webbgränssnitt[32] avsedda för mobila plattformar med enkla webbläsare.,Sweedish
"År 2009 öppnades en nyare version som idag är den officiella mobila vyn,[33] avsedd för smartmobiler såsom Symbian-telefoner, iPhone-enheter och Android-enheter.",Sweedish
[34] Engelskspråkiga Wikipedias mobila vy har adressen en.m.wikipedia.org och svenskspråkiga mobila vyn sv.m.wikipedia.org.,Sweedish
Även ett antal mobila appar för ändamålet finns.,Sweedish
"Den mobila webbvyn accessas mer ofta än den stationära vyn, för svenskspråkiga Wikipedia sedan slutet av 2015, särskilt under semestermånader, och skillnaden växer.",Sweedish
[35][36] Mobila Wikipediaappar används bara för en bråkdel av accesserna.,Sweedish
"[37] Wikipedia är även tillgängligt via spelkonsoler som Playstation 3, Nintendo Wii och Xbox 360.",Sweedish
"Där kan man ladda ner databasdumpar av åtminstone engelskspråkiga Wikipedia, men det är då den vanliga webbversionen av uppslagsverket och ingen speciellt utvecklad version.",Sweedish
Wikipedia är i regel fritt tillgänglig i alla delar av världen där man har fri tillgång till internet.,Sweedish
"Wikipedia censurerar inte sig själv från provocerande eller stötande material, men modereras genom konsensusbeslut baserat på sin egen raderingspolicy.",Sweedish
"Dock är stiftelsen Wikimedia Foundation skyldiga att efter en tid radera innehåll som bryter mot amerikansk lag, eftersom servrarna är placerade där, nämligen upphovsrättsbrott, förtal, avslöjande av personuppgifter och brott mot barnskyddslagstiftning.",Sweedish
"Till skillnad från nätcommunities som har sina servrar i Sverige är Wikipedia egentligen inte skyldig att följa lagen om elektronisk kommunikation, men dess amerikanska motsvarigheter.",Sweedish
"Stiftelsens svenska avdelning arbetar emellertid även med europeisk lagstiftning, exempelvis dataskyddsförordningen[38] Wikipedia påverkas sannolikt inte direkt av upphovsrättsdirektivet.",Sweedish
[39] I likhet med andra sociala medier saknar Wikipedia ansvarig utgivare  och utgivningsbevis i Sverige.,Sweedish
"Wikipedias ocensurerade innehåll, och att uppslagsverket inte behöver följa andra länders lagar än USA:s, har anförts som skäl när det blivit utsatt för restriktioner och blockeringar i vissa länder.",Sweedish
"Detta har främst skett i länder med internetcensur och inskränkningar i yttrande- och tryckfriheten, på senare tid i Folkrepubliken Kina (""Kinesiska brandväggen"" bland annat sedan 23 april 2019) och Turkiet (från april 2017 till januari 2020 som skylldes på skriverier om Turkiets inblandning i Syriska inbördeskriget[40]).",Sweedish
I Nordkorea begränsas allmänhetens tillgång till utländska internetsajter.,Sweedish
"Tillfällig total blockering av vissa eller alla språkversioner av Wikipedia har skett i Venezuela (i januari 2019), Uzbekistan (2007, 2008, 2012, 2016), Pakistan (2006 och 2010 på grund av hädelse), Syrien (2008–2009), Saudiarabien (2006),[41] och Tunisien (2006).",Sweedish
"Innan 2016 filtrerades vissa Wikipediasidor i Ryssland (om självmord och droger), Saudiarabien[42], Iran och Thailand.",Sweedish
"Efter att Wikipedia gick över helt till https-kryptering blev det tekniskt mycket svårt för internetleverantörer att filtrera specifika sidor, och dessa länder hävde då filtreringen.",Sweedish
Krypteringen gör det dessutom mycket svårt att övervaka vem som läser vilken Wikipediaartikel.,Sweedish
"Även i länder med hög grad av yttrandefrihet har censur och filtrering skett, såsom i Frankrike (inrikesdepartementets säkerhetstjänst försökte 2013 att censurera en artikel om en militär radiostation[43]) och i Storbritannien (en artikel som innehöll en bild som kategoriserades som barnpornografi av organisationen Internet Watch Foundation blockerades av många internetleverantörer 2008).",Sweedish
Lagförslag i Italien[44] om förhandsgranskning av materialet på Wikipedia ledde till stor uppmärksamhet och förslaget drogs tillbaka.,Sweedish
Wikipedia kan redigeras av vem som helst.,Sweedish
Detta gör att encyklopedin är beroende av ett stort antal välmenande skribenter som på frivillig basis håller efter den lilla grupp av skribenter som på olika sätt ställer till problem.,Sweedish
Det sätt genom vilket materialet på Wikipedia skapas leder även till problem då felaktig och vinklad information kan läggas till.,Sweedish
Grundtanken är dock att de flesta användare är intresserade av att bevara och skydda Wikipedia och att dessa därför snabbt kommer att återställa efter klotter och bidrag som inte anses hålla tillräckligt hög standard.,Sweedish
Arbetssättet bygger även på idén att samarbete och diskussion mellan alla användare leder till att gruppen i helhet utvecklas och att konsensus om vad som räknas som neutralt kan uppnås även i svårare frågor.,Sweedish
Grundtankarna går alltså tvärt emot idén om att publiceringen av kunskap bör begränsas till en liten grupp utvalda och speciellt kunniga personer som producerar material i en hierarkisk arbetsdelning.,Sweedish
"En del användare har användarbefogenheter som ger dem tillträde till särskilda verktyg som underlättar arbetet mot klotter, vandalisering och konflikter.",Sweedish
"Exempelvis väljs vissa användare till administratörer, som tillfälligt eller tillsvidare kan blockera användare som inte respekterar riktlinjer och konsensusbeslut.",Sweedish
"Administratörerna kan också hindra anonyma användare, eller icke-administratörer, från redigering av sidor som ofta är föremål för attacker eller konflikter.",Sweedish
"Gemenskapen poängterar att administratörerna inte skall tillmätas större auktoritet i sak, utan endast stödja själva processen.",Sweedish
"Flera stora Wikipediaversioner, dock ej den svenska, har infört moderering genom funktionen flagged revisions, alltså att ändringar som görs av nya eller icke inloggade användare inte visas omedelbart för icke inloggade besökare utan fördröjs tills någon tillförlitlig etablerad användare har granskat och godkänt dem.",Sweedish
[45] Innehållet i Wikipedia omfattas av juridiska skäl av lagstiftningen (särskilt lagen om upphovsrätt) i Virginia där Wikipedias servrar[b] numera befinner sig.,Sweedish
"Utöver detta är Wikipedias redaktionella principer sammanfattade i de så kallade ""fem pelarna"", och många policyer och riktlinjer syftar till att utforma innehållet på lämpligt sätt.",Sweedish
"Även dessa regler finns lagrade i wiki-form, och Wikipedia-skribenter kan skriva och revidera dessa policyer och riktlinjer.",Sweedish
"[47] Dessa riktlinjer och policyer tillämpas genom att Wikipedia-skribenterna kan ta bort, märka eller ändra artikelmaterial som inte uppfyller dem.",Sweedish
De regler som de icke-engelska utgåvorna av Wikipedia har baseras ofta på en översättning av reglerna på den engelskspråkiga Wikipedia och skrivs i Sverige utifrån lokala svenskspråkiga diskussioner.,Sweedish
Wikipedia är också en internetgemenskap.,Sweedish
"Som sådan har den utvecklat en egen kultur och egna traditioner, och de sammanfattas i fem grundprinciper: De olika språkversionerna av Wikipedia fungerar som stora internetbaserade grupparbeten, med målet att skapa en encyklopedi.",Sweedish
"Kontakter och diskussioner mellan medlemmarna i grupparbetet sker i regel i samma gränssnitt, via artiklarnas eller användarnas diskussionssidor eller genom de olika deltagarportalerna.",Sweedish
"Förutom samarbetet och diskussioner online, arrangeras olika sorters fysiska träffar mellan Wikipediaanvändare.",Sweedish
"I USA finns exempelvis Great American Wiknic, en årlig Wikipediaträff som under sommaren anordnas i flera amerikanska städer.",Sweedish
"[48] Ibland samlas Wikipediaanvändare lokalt till olika specialevenemang med syftet att bidra till projektet, exempelvis genom att ägna en dag åt fotografering av ett område (""fotosafari"") eller för att redigera tillsammans på en skrivstuga.",Sweedish
"Skrivstugor har ofta specifika teman, där Wikipediaartiklar om kvinnor är ett särskilt vanligt tema.",Sweedish
Lokalt anordnas ofta mindre och informella träffar på exempelvis något café eller pub.,Sweedish
På svenskspråkiga Wikipedia kallas dessa möten Wikifika eller Wikipub.,Sweedish
"Wikipedias trovärdighet, både jämfört med andra uppslagsverk och andra specialiserade källor, kan analyseras på olika sätt, bland annat genom blindtester av experter, genom statistik, genom analys av historiska mönster och genom att analysera styrkor och svagheter i wikimodellen.",Sweedish
"På Wikipedia finns ingen redaktion utan allt arbete utförs av mestadels anonyma frivilliga, vilket kan förväntas påverka tillförlitligheten negativt.",Sweedish
Å andra sidan finns det fler som kan rätta felen.,Sweedish
År 2014 mätte forskare vid Harvard Business School hur politiskt vinklat språket är (andelen ideologiskt laddade formuleringar) i 70 000 engelskspråkiga Wikipediaartiklar om politik.,Sweedish
"De mätte också artiklarnas neutralitet i form av balansen mellan antal formuleringar som är vanliga bland USA:s demokrater (exempelvis “poor people”, “tax breaks” och “change the rules”) respektive konservativa (“illegal aliens”, “death tax” och “border security”).",Sweedish
"De utvärderade även motsvarande artiklar i det traditionella uppslagsverket Encyclopedia Britannica, i syfte att jämföra neutraliteten av kollektivt författad information med expertgenererat material.",Sweedish
"[49] Artikelhistoriken visade att Wikipediaartiklar i ett tidigt skede ofta har ett vinklat språk, och kan växla mellan i huvudsak vänster- och högervinkling under tidens gång, men de artiklar som har redigerats flest gånger (tusentals gånger) har försumbara skillnader i vinkling och neutralitet jämfört med Encyclopedia Britannicas motsvarande artiklar, och är dessutom mer fördjupade.",Sweedish
Bidragsgivare till Wikipedias politikartiklar som har formulerat sig radikalt tenderar att förändra sitt sätt att skriva så att deras bidrag efter några år innehåller märkbart färre ideologiskt laddade formuleringar.,Sweedish
Emellertid är antal redigeringar av en Wikipediaartikel endast svagt korrelerat med antal läsare av artikeln – många populära artiklar är nya och har omarbetats få gånger.,Sweedish
"Detta gör att ur läsarens synvinkel är fortfarande engelskspråkiga Wikipedias politikartiklar mer vinklade än Encyclopedia Britannicas artiklar, något oftare mot vänster än höger, men att balansen är olika för olika ämnesområden.",Sweedish
"[49] Wikipedia bedöms dock vara betydligt mer neutral än kollektivt och användargenererat material i allmänhet på Internet (bloggar, sociala nätverk, diskussionsforum, kommentarsfält och andra wikier), sannolikt därför att de senare skrivs av mindre communities än Wikipedia och har färre innehållsstyrande policyer.",Sweedish
Därför är dessa avsevärt mer känsliga för starka uppfattningar och kontroversiella påståenden som framförs av dominerande bidragsgivare.,Sweedish
"[49] Wikipedias diskussionsforum karaktäriseras, trots redigeringskrig och kritik för pedanteri och sexism, tvärtom av sansade diskussioner mellan meningsmotståndare som hittar gemensam konsensus, och även vid djupt kontroversiella ämnen.",Sweedish
Med hänvisning till denna forskning har debattörer därför beskrivit Wikipedia som en möjlig lösning på internets största problem med osaklig polarisering och desinformation.,Sweedish
[50] Då Wikipedia är öppet för gemensam redigering och kan redigeras anonymt bedöms Wikipedias trovärdighet ofta efter hur fort felaktig eller missvisande information som avsiktligen har lagts in raderas.,Sweedish
"På engelskspråkiga Wikipedia gjordes en undersökning 2007 som visade att ca fem procent av det som skrivs på Wikipedia är klotter men att det har tagits bort inom en mediantid på 14 minuter, men i enstaka fall kan ligga kvar i flera år utan att upptäckas.",Sweedish
"Risken att den artikelversion man läser innehåller klotter beräknades till cirka 0,004 procent.",Sweedish
[51] En undersökning som publicerades 2005 i tidskriften Nature visar att när det gäller artiklar om vetenskapliga ämnen var engelskspråkiga Wikipedia nästan lika korrekt som Encyclopædia Britannica.,Sweedish
Wikipedia hade också ungefär samma antal allvarliga fel i artiklarna.,Sweedish
[52][53] Uppgifterna har ifrågasatts av Encyclopædia Britannica.,Sweedish
[54] I en jämförelse utförd av Svenska Dagbladet 2006 där nio experter granskade varsin av nio artiklar mellan Nationalencyklopedin och svenskspråkiga Wikipedia var Nationalencyklopedin bäst i sex fall och Wikipedia var bäst i tre fall.,Sweedish
"[55] Statens medieråd skrev (i en icke daterad artikel tillgänglig 2015) att ""De stickprov som gjorts visar dock på små skillnader.",Sweedish
Där NE vinner i tillförlitlighet vinner Wikipedia i aktualitet.,Sweedish
Man ska dock tänka på att vissa texter på Wikipedia bara är påbörjade medan andra kan vara betydligt mer utvecklade än innehållet i NE.,Sweedish
"""[56] Ungefär ett år senare togs formuleringen om tillförlitlighet och aktualitet bort i en senare version av artikeln.",Sweedish
[57] Den 24 oktober 2005 publicerade brittiska The Guardian en artikel med titeln ”Can you trust Wikipedia?” ('Kan man lita på Wikipedia?'),Sweedish
där en panel av experter ombads granska sju artiklar som berörde deras specialområden och betygsätta artiklarna med 0-10 poäng.,Sweedish
"Alla artiklarna fick mellan 0 och 8 poäng, men de flesta fick mellan 5 och 8 poäng.",Sweedish
"[58] Den vanligaste kritiken var: Det vanligaste berömmet var: Kritik och skepsis mot Wikipedia har funnits sedan start, och var särskilt framträdande när allmänheten först började upptäcka fenomenet och olika incidenter inträffade första gången.",Sweedish
Eftersom engelskspråkiga Wikipedia är den största språkupplagan tar mycket av kritiken sina exempel därifrån.,Sweedish
Till de skarpaste kritikerna hör ofta personer vars bidrag till Wikipedia har raderats.,Sweedish
Wikipedia får kritik för att artiklarnas tillförlitlighet är blandad och för att vissa artiklar är mycket korta eller har knapphändigt med källhänvisningar.,Sweedish
"Wikipedia får kritik för att författarna i hög grad är västerländska män, ofta med akademisk bakgrund, och att balansen mellan artikelämnen och perspektiv kan påverkas av dessa författares intresseområden.",Sweedish
Wikipedias öppenhet gör den mottaglig även för redigeringar som inte är välmenade.,Sweedish
"Eftersom öppna nätverk fortfarande är en ny företeelse för de flesta, är många besökares första redigering rent klotter - de testar om ""Redigera den här sidan"" verkligen är det den ger sig ut för att vara.",Sweedish
Många användare upptäckte Wikipedia på liknande sätt och eftersom klotter är lätt att ta bort är toleransen också ganska hög gentemot företeelsen.,Sweedish
Det tar inte lång tid innan uppenbart klotter är borttaget.,Sweedish
Däremot tolereras inte avsiktlig vandalism.,Sweedish
Användare som kontinuerligt förstör artiklar kan utestängas från framtida deltagande i projektet genom att en administratör blockerar deras användarkonto eller IP-adress.,Sweedish
"En tidig studie gjord av IBM 2003 visade att vandalism i genomsnitt tas bort mycket snabbt, men i enstaka fall kan ligga kvar mycket länge.",Sweedish
[59] En annan tidig studie (från 2007) som mätte sidvisningar på engelskspråkiga Wikipedia med felaktigt vandaliserat innehåll kom fram till att 42 procent av allt klotter eller vandalism återställdes innan det hunnit ses av icke inloggade användare.,Sweedish
[60] Ett annat beteende som ofta ses som ett problem är bidragsgivare som använder flera användarnamn utöver sitt egentliga i vilseledande syfte.,Sweedish
Dessa kallas sock puppets eller marionetter.,Sweedish
"Grundaren Larry Sanger övergav tidigt projektet, och har sedan dess varit en av dess kritiker.",Sweedish
Han menade våren 2020 att Wikipedia allvarligt lider av bristande neutralitet därför att man enligt honom har övergett principen om att återge många perspektiv och att inte ta ställning.,Sweedish
"Engelskspråkiga Wikipedia har istället börjat tillämpa en princip om att undvika falsk balans, och tar därför ställning för etablerade vetenskapliga uppfattningar.",Sweedish
Enligt Sanger främställs därför minoritetsuppfattningar bland forskare ibland som pseudovetenskap.,Sweedish
"Sanger ger även exempel på icke-vetenskaplig religionskritik som har fått utrymme, och på att Wikipedia enligt honom ger vänsterpolitisk kritik större utrymme än högerperspektiv.",Sweedish
[61] Wikipedia har anklagats för att ha en tendens att täcka vissa ämnen oproportionerligt i förhållande till hur viktigt ämnet är.,Sweedish
"I en intervju med The Guardian[62] 2004 sade Dale Hoiberg, Encyclopædia Britannicas chefredaktör, om engelskspråkiga Wikipedia: Intervjun publicerades 26 oktober 2004.",Sweedish
"28 mars 2005 hade artikeln om kinesisk konst blivit tre gånger så stor som den om orkanen Frances, underartiklar ej inräknade, och artikeln om Tony Blair var 50 % större än den om Coronation Street.",Sweedish
"Wikipedias förespråkare pekar på sådana exempel för att visa att vinklingarna kommer att bli mindre med tiden, medan motståndare anser att just dessa artiklar fick extra uppmärksamhet på grund av intervjun, och att ökningen inte gäller alla artiklar.",Sweedish
[källa behövs] År 2006 listade hemsidan wikipedia-watch.org ett dussintal plagieringar gjorda av redaktörer på den engelska versionen av Wikipedia.,Sweedish
"Jimmy Wales som varit med och grundat Wikipedia sade i detta sammanhang: ""Vi måste hantera sådana händelser på fullaste allvar, utan nåd, eftersom denna typ av plagiering strider till 100 % mot alla våra grundläggande principer.",Sweedish
"[63] Wikipedia har kritiserats, bland annat av Larry Sanger 2012, för att tillåta sexuellt innehåll i sina artiklar, bland annat bilder och filmer av onani och ejakulation samt även foton från pornografiska filmer i flera artiklar.",Sweedish
[64] Kritikerna menade att sexuellt innehåll visas för frikostigt på Wikipedia och att bilderna är för lättåtkomliga för barn som eventuellt använder Wikipedia i sitt skolarbete.,Sweedish
[64][65] Exempelvis visas det kontroversiella originalomslaget till albumet Virgin Killer av bandet Scorpions på engelska Wikipedia.,Sweedish
Omslaget föreställer en naken minderårig flicka.,Sweedish
2008 blockerades artikeln under fyra dagar av de flesta av Storbritanniens internetleverantörer.,Sweedish
"[66] Detta efter att den rapporterats som barnpornografi av ”The Internet Watch Foundation”, en ideell organisation som letar efter olagligt innehåll på Internet och samarbetar med bland annat brittisk polis.",Sweedish
De ansåg då att införandet av bilden i artikeln var ”smaklöst”.,Sweedish
"[67] Efter att Wikipedias grundare Larry Sanger pekat ut vad han ansåg vara fall av barnpornografi i Wikipedias bildbank Wikimedia Commons, tog Wikipedias andra grundare Jimmy Wales hastigt bort flera bilder med sexuellt innehåll, inklusive sakligt material, utan att konsultera användarna i stort.",Sweedish
Detta har han fått kritik för och har nu frivilligt gett upp en del av de privilegier han haft som grundare.,Sweedish
"[68] Under 2007 utvecklade CalTech-studenten Virgil Griffith webbtjänsten ""WikiScanner"" som samkör flera register.",Sweedish
"Därigenom upptäcktes det att olika organisationer, till exempel CIA, Vatikanen och Astra Zeneca redigerat vinklat i artiklar som rörde deras respektive områden.",Sweedish
"Generellt betraktades företagens beteende som dåligt, medan Wikiscanner spåddes få stor betydelse för att övervaka kvaliteten på Wikipedia.",Sweedish
"[69] WikiScanning-historien uppmärksammades av The Independent, som fastslog att många censureringar, som gjorts på en rad Wikipediaartiklar av användare med egenintresse, hade upptäckts: Wikipedia har kritiserats för att ha löst definierade krav på vilka ämnen som anses vara tillräckligt kända att det är relevanta för uppslagsverket och kan få egna artiklar utan att raderas.",Sweedish
Författaren Nicholson Baker skrev i The New York Review of Books att diskussionen kring vad som är relevant är så kontroversiell att ingen kan bilda sig en klar uppfattning och hävdade att artiklar om ämnen som borde vara relevanta lätt raderas.,Sweedish
[70] Wikipedia har kritiserats för att en liten grupp människor står för den största delen av innehållet.,Sweedish
[71] Mätningar av Wikipedias neutralitet visar att det kan krävas ett mycket stort antal bidrag (ofta tusentals) för att en Wikipediaartikel ska uppnå kvalitet som är jämförbar med en expertförfattad uppslagsverksartikel.,Sweedish
"Det kollaborativa skrivandet är därmed ineffektivt, och gör att nyskapade artiklar och artiklar som inte har många bidragsgivare kan ha stora brister.",Sweedish
[49] Auktoritetsbristen och avsaknad av expertgranskning innebär att en kvalitetssäkring saknas av artiklarnas lägstanivå.,Sweedish
När nya bidrag görs till Wikipedia handlar det ofta om små delar eller delar av en sida som ej utsätts för granskning.,Sweedish
Hög- och lågkvalitetsändringar kan då blanda sig i samma artikel.,Sweedish
"Till exempel sa historikern Roy Rosenzweig: ""Rent generellt är själva skrivandet Wikipedias akilleshäl.",Sweedish
Grupper skriver sällan bra och bidragen på Wikipedia är ofta av ojämn kvalitet som beror på att meningar och stycken skrivna av olika personer har sammanfogats.,Sweedish
"""[72] Även om en artikel är faktamässigt korrekt kan den lida av andra kvalitestsbrister, exempelvis att språket har bristande läsbarhet, ibland så att det ser ut som att den har maskinöversatts flera gånger.",Sweedish
[73]  Orsaken kan vara att olika delar har redigerats av olika bidragsgivare med olika grad av språkliga färdigheter och olika syn på hur tekniskt detaljerat språket ska vara.,Sweedish
"I mindre språkversioner av Wikipedia kan bristerna bero på att mycket av innehållet kommer från översättningar av gamla versioner av Wikipediaartiklar på andra språk, och från nationell nyhetsmedia, i stället för från aktuella auktoritativa källor.",Sweedish
Översättningen kan vara bristfällig och kvalitetsbrister kan ligga kvar länge om få kontrollerar artikeln.,Sweedish
"Bibliotekarien Philip Bradley säger i en intervju med The Guardian i oktober 2004 att ""Det huvudsakliga problemet är bristen på auktoritet.",Sweedish
"Med tryckta publikationer måste utgivaren se till att den information denne publicerar är sanningsenlig då deras levebröd hänger på det.""",Sweedish
[62][74] Encyclopædia Britannicas före detta chefredaktör Robert McHenry och Paul Vallely har även de noterat att Wikipedias läsare inte kan veta vem som skrivit artikeln de läser - den kan vara skriven av någon som inte är en expert på ämnet.,Sweedish
"McHenry har också framfört att Wikipedia faller på att den säger sig vara en encyklopedi, ett ord som inger en auktoritet och pålitlighet som är oförenligt med koncepten öppenhet och wiki.",Sweedish
"[75][76] Larry Sanger, Nupedias förre chefredaktör, har i en intervju med Kuro5hin sagt att ett av Wikipedias stora problem är den ""anti-elitism"" som finns.",Sweedish
Wikipedia ber användarna att verifiera innehållet genom att uppge och kontrollera källor.,Sweedish
"Dessa kan i praktiken vara bloggar, och ibland kan det visa sig att en artikel på Wikipedia verifieras genom att innehållet kontrolleras mot en källa, som i sin tur har använt Wikipedia som källa utan att uppge detta.",Sweedish
I en magisteruppsats har det visat sig att över 90 procent av de gymnasieelever som ingick i undersökningsgruppen ser förekomsten av källor som det främsta kriteriet i bedömningen av en artikels tillförlitlighet.,Sweedish
"Ett betydligt mindre antal elever, bara två procent, tycker att författaren till artikeln är viktig.",Sweedish
"[77] Detta skiljer sig därför markant från andra uppslagsverk, där till exempel en aktad författare eller forskare kan anses som en trovärdig källa.",Sweedish
"I ""Cult of the Amateur – How Today’s Internet is Killing Our Culture and Assaulting Our Economy"",[78] berättar IT-entreprenören Andrew Keen om sitt missnöje med Wikipedia.",Sweedish
Han menar att de amatörer som skriver på sidan växer på bekostnad av forskare och experter.,Sweedish
Detta bidrar till en disharmoni när webben utvecklas och författaren får ett samspel med publiken.,Sweedish
"Gränsen mellan amatör och expert suddas ut då amatörernas bloggar eller redigeringar inte alltid är kvalitetssäkrade, utan helt enkelt det som blir det mest intressanta och som då hörs mest.",Sweedish
"Han menar dock inte att det är den öppna tekniken, där alla är välkomna som användare som är problemet, utan själva implementeringen - det krävs en balansgång mellan öppenheten och auktoriteten.",Sweedish
[79] Under åren har det inletts flera projekt för att få forskare att hjälpa till att stärka kvaliteten i Wikipedias artiklar.,Sweedish
"[80] Wikipedias regler tillåter inte  originalforskning och att nya begrepp myntas där, utan de måste första ha publicerats, men nya begrepp kan få större spridning om de nämns på Wikipedia, och forskaren som har myntat begreppet kan därmed bli citerad mer ofta i studentuppsatser och vetenskapliga publikationer.",Sweedish
Undersökningar (bland annat 2017[81]) har visat att ord som presenterats i Wikipedia-artiklar senare ofta kan dyka upp i akademiska uppsatser.,Sweedish
[82][83][84] Den akademiska tidskriften RNA Biology började 2008 koppla samman artikelskrivandet i tidskriften och dess relaterade databas med skrivandet på Wikipedia.,Sweedish
"[85] I bokkapitlet ""Wikipedianer: om Wikipedia i undervisningen"" i antologin ""Pedagogiskt arbete i teori och praktik: om bibliotekariens roll för studenters och doktoranders lärande"" (red.",Sweedish
"Birgitta Hansson & Anna Lyngfelt) skriver högskolebibliotekarien Jan Hjalmarsson om hur Wikipedia kan användas i högre utbildning för att träna studenterna i att jämföra källor, diskutera och problematisera olika typer av digitala källor.",Sweedish
"Han beskriver hur han har arbetat med Wikipedia i undervisningen inom etnologiämnet på Södertörns högskola, och hur studenterna fick en uppgift som innebar att skulle skriva/redigera artiklar på Wikipedia om olika för etnologiämnet relevanta vetenskapliga begrepp som t.ex.",Sweedish
"subkultur, motkultur, genus och intersektionalitet.",Sweedish
"[86] Ett annat exempel på hur studenterna kan arbeta med Wikipedia inom ramen för sina högskolestudier beskrivs i artikeln ""Bildning för vår tids bibliotek"" skriven av Karin Grönvall och Jan Hjalmarsson där de lyfter fram ett samarbete med ämnet marinarkeologi på Södertörns högskola.",Sweedish
"[87] Den globala enkätundersökningen Wikimedia General User Survey 2009[88] genomfördes under hösten 2008 bland besökare av 21 språkversioner av Wikipedia, främst den engelska, tyska och spanska versionen, dock ej den svenska versionen.",Sweedish
Deltagarna i enkäten var boende i 228 olika länder.,Sweedish
"1,14% var från Sverige.",Sweedish
"Av enkätsvaren var 35% Wikipediaförfattare (i huvudsak icke regelbundna bidragsgivare), medan 65% läste Wikipedia utan att bidra.",Sweedish
"0,98% var dessutom administratörer.",Sweedish
"12,8% av författarna och 31,2% av läsarna var kvinnor.",Sweedish
Deltagarna var i åldrarna 10 - 85 år.,Sweedish
"Medelåldern bland författarna var 26,8 år, och bland läsarna 25,3 år.",Sweedish
"Gällande högsta examen som Wikipediaförfattarna hade uppnått hade 4,6% doktorerat, 15,1% hade högst uppnått masters/magisterexamen, 28,4% högst kandidatexamen, 33,4% endast gymnasieexamen, och 12,4% endast grundskoleexamen.",Sweedish
Enligt en artikel i DN är bara drygt 10 procent av de som bidrar till Wikipedia kvinnor.,Sweedish
"[89][90] I en studie bland internetanvändare som genomfördes under 2007 av Hitwise (australiskt marknadsundersökningsföretag) och som även återgavs i tidningen Time,[91] fann man att Wikipedias besökare var nästan jämnt fördelade mellan män och kvinnor men att 60% av alla redigeringar gjordes av män.",Sweedish
2018 rapporterade The Guardian att studier visar att endast 16% av redigerare på Wikipedia är kvinnor.,Sweedish
"[92] I konferensartikeln ""Talk before you Type: Coordination in Wikipedia""[93] har artiklarnas diskussionssidor undersökts.",Sweedish
"Författarna har klassificerat sidorna i elva olika kategorier: koordinering av redigering, fakta som saknas, klotter, policy och riktlinjer, länkar till interna Wikipediaresurser (andra diskussionssidor), ""off topic"", omröstningar, granskning för artikelrekommendation, ""infobox"", bilder och övrigt.",Sweedish
Författarna menar att en del strategisk planering av artikelredigering sker genom diskussionssidorna.,Sweedish
I en tidigare artikel hade samma författare presenterat diskussionssidorna som en arena enbart för konfliktlösning.,Sweedish
"Författarna hävdar också att samtalet i diskussionssidorna är formaliserat (vissa etikettregler finns, som att signera sina inlägg) och policydrivet (referenser till riktlinjerna förekommer ofta).",Sweedish
"En beskrivande studie[94] som analyserade engelskspråkiga Wikipedias policyer och riktlinjer fram till september 2007 identifierade en del intresseväckande statistik: Även om grundprincipen ""Strunta i reglerna"" (ignore-all-rules) endast är sexton ord lång på engelskspråkiga Wikipedia så är sidan som förklarar policyn över femhundra ord lång.",Sweedish
"Den hänvisar läsarna till sju andra dokument, den har genererat över 8 000 ord av diskussion och har redigerats över 100 gånger under mindre än ett år.",Sweedish
"Studien jämförde även utvecklingen av policyer i form av tillförda ord jämfört med när de först skrevs: Siffran för ""deletion"" ansågs ej vara rättvis och heltäckande då policyn har delats upp i flera underpolicyer.",Sweedish
Wikipedia gör det möjligt att redigera anonymt.,Sweedish
"De som redigerar måste inte uppge sin identitet, eller ens en e-postadress.",Sweedish
"En studie från 2007 vid Dartmouth College av franskspråkiga och nederländska Wikipedia, pekar på att i motsats till det förväntade sociala mönstret, var de som redigerade anonymt några av de mest produktiva bidragsgivarna av innehåll med hög klass.",Sweedish
"[förtydliga] Förklaringen till detta[förtydliga] skulle enligt forskarna ligga i att förutsättningarna för att producera det som man kan kalla för ”allmän egendom” (collective goods) är så annorlunda vad gäller Wikipedia, jämfört med andra sammanhang.",Sweedish
Det anses allmänt bland sociologer att det behövs en kritisk massa när en heterogen grupp med individer med både olika förutsättningar och motivation ska komma igång med att producera ”allmän egendom”.,Sweedish
Denna uppnås med det produktionssätt som till exempel Wikipedia har på ett enklare och snabbare sätt än annars.,Sweedish
Det blir fler som deltar och kvalitén ökar.,Sweedish
"Med andra ord gör tekniken det möjligt att nå tidigare outnyttjade ""resurser"", genom att tröskeln för att delta sänkts.",Sweedish
Forskarna valde 1 000 bidrag av registrerade användare och 1 000 bidrag av icke registrerade användare slumpmässigt ur vardera språkgrupp (av totalt mer än 87 000 bidrag den 1 mars 2005).,Sweedish
[95][förtydliga] I en studie [96] utförd av forskare från University of Washington och HP Labs har man försökt analysera redigeringskrig och konflikter i engelskspråkiga Wikipedias datadump från 2006: Wikipedia är ett massornas samarbete där formuleringen av artiklar inte bestäms definitivt utan genom konsensus.,Sweedish
De sociala relationerna mellan Wikipedianerna leder ibland till konflikter.,Sweedish
"Policyer (""policies"") och riktlinjer (""guidelines"") underlättar ofta konfliktlösning men forskarna har hittat flera exempel där fundamentalt olika tolkningar av policyer inte har lett till någon lösning utan tvärtom förhindrat konsensus.",Sweedish
Författarna har valt att analysera engelskspråkiga Wikipedias datadump från 2006.,Sweedish
I denna dump har man försökt hitta redigeringskrig genom att studera artiklar med minst 250 redigeringar på dess diskussionssidor.,Sweedish
"Detta motsvarade 0,3 % av alla diskussionssidor.",Sweedish
"Dessa utvalda diskussionssidor täckte in 28,4 % av alla redigeringar på diskussionssidorna i dumpen.",Sweedish
"Dessutom täcker detta urval in 51,1 % av alla länkar till policyer.",Sweedish
Sedan har man från de utvalda diskussionssidorna riktat in sig på kritiska sektioner genom att välja redigeringar under en tidsperiod då det var både många redigeringar på artikelsidan såväl som på diskussionssidan.,Sweedish
Man hittade att tillit till konsensus ofta leder till ett antal tillfälliga maktspel.,Sweedish
Maktspel som uppträdde ofta handlade om: Konsensus är aldrig slutgiltig och i dispyter diskuteras ofta legitimiteten i tidigare konsensus.,Sweedish
Veteraner vill inte slösa tid på frågor som de anser lösta medan nybörjare uppfattar att deras perspektiv inte representerats i tidigare argument och därför vill lyfta konsensus till diskussion igen.,Sweedish
"Artikelförfattarna menar att Wikipedias nätgemenskap främjas av det svåra arbetet att söka konsensus och att sådant arbete kanske är det största formuleringsarbetet i Wikipedia och motsätter sig andra forskares åsikt att dessa aspekter av samarbetet är ""kostsamt"" och ""improduktivt"".",Sweedish
Man erkänner dock att en del koordinationsarbete kan vara överflödigt men att eventuella verktyg för att underlätta koordinering inte får förstöra den sammanhållande funktion som konsensussökande diskussioner också skapar.,Sweedish
Med koordinationsarbete menar man mödan att beskriva och arkivera tidigare diskussioner samt att hitta bland arkiverade diskussioner.,Sweedish
"Det man efterfrågar är bland annat visualiseringsverktyg för att annotera tidigare konsensus och vilka som var med i denna process, för att sammanfatta konflikter över tid så att man lättare kan förstå en artikels tillstånd.",Sweedish
"Ett meritsystemverktyg skulle kunna motivera till meningsfulla redigeringar, men kan även ge upphov till konkurrens.",Sweedish
Ett innehållsdrivet meritsystem riskerar att bidragsgivare av rädsla för att sänka sin meritstatus försöker förhindra att deras text ändras.,Sweedish
"Forskare vid Carnegie Mellon University har utifrån en mängd statistik försökt skapa en modell
[97] för att förstå och förutsäga administratörsval på engelskspråkiga Wikipedia.",Sweedish
I modellen har de tagit in flera faktorer som i olika utsträckning påverkade resultatet av valet.,Sweedish
"Bland annat kunde de visa att antalet artikelredigeringar påverkade väldigt lite, men att policy- och projektredigeringar höjde chanserna från 1,8 % till 17-19 % per 1 000 redigeringar.",Sweedish
"De visade även att aktivitet i inom olika områden och att skriva redigeringssammanfattningar ökade chanserna att bli vald, medan medverkan i medlingsärenden över lag sänkte chanserna.",Sweedish
Modellen använde dock rätt trubbiga mått på aktiviteten och forskarna konstaterar att man bör analysera vad administratörerna gör mer exakt.,Sweedish
"Forskarna påpekar själva att modellen inte tar vara på kvalitén i redigeringarna utan bara utgår från kvantiteten, men den har ändå visat sig kunna förutsäga 74,8 % av valresultaten.",Sweedish
Några exempel på faktorer: (Värden inom parentes är inte statistiskt säkerställda) I studien The Work of Sustaining Order in Wikipedia: The Banning of a Vandal[98] undersöks hur automatiserade och halvautomatiserade verktyg i kombination med samarbete bekämpar vandalism.,Sweedish
Den visar på att sådana verktygs användning ökar i en omfattning som få tidigare har uppmärksammat.,Sweedish
Studien inkluderar en fallstudie och ger en inblick i om hur snabbt en envis klottrares bidrag återställs och hur klottraren sedan blockeras.,Sweedish
"I studien Wikipedians are born, not made: a study of power editors on Wikipedia[99] från 2009 bekräftar Katherine Panciera m.fl.",Sweedish
tidigare undersökningar som visar att en relativt liten grupp användare står för en stor del av redigeringarna och för en stor del av det material som blir kvar i artiklarna.,Sweedish
"Författarna visar att dessa användare går att känna igen från deras första tid på Wikipedia, bland annat genom att de gör flera redigeringar per dag.",Sweedish
"Dessa användare hänvisar också ofta till Wikipediaprojektets normer, såsom att skriva från en neutral utgångspunkt.",Sweedish
Författarna föreslår olika åtgärder för att öka andelen användare som stannar och förblir produktiva.,Sweedish
"I avhandlingen Frihetens rike: wikipedianer om sin praktik, sitt produktionssätt och kapitalismen (Uppsala universitet, 2015) undersöker Arwid Lund hur wikipedianer ser på sin roll som bidragsgivare till uppslagsverket.",Sweedish
"Frågeställningarna rör även synen på Wikipedias roll i samhället, i ljuset av kapitalistiska och kommunistiska infallsvinklar.",Sweedish
Avhandlingen baseras på ett antal djupintervjuer med både tillfälliga och mer etablerade svenskspråkiga wikipedianer.,Sweedish
[100] Som en av internets största samarbetsprojekt och mest omfattande informationskällor har Wikipedia rönt uppmärksamhet i olika sammanhang.,Sweedish
"Här listas några exempel:  Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia har ännu inte någon sida med namnet ”Machine learning”: Andra orsaker till varför detta meddelande visas: 
Vi letar alla efter snabba sätt att bli mer flytande på engelska jag vet att jag förstår vad som händer är att det bara finns några ord som kretsar kring vår hjärna och vi måste göra hela konversationen med bara fantastiskt fantastiskt coolt eller episkt så vad sägs om oss lära dig några smarta nya engelska ord som du kan använda i ditt dagliga liv och höja ditt ordförråd på några minuter.",Sweedish
så idag ska vi lära oss tio nya smarta ord deras betydelse rotord och exempelmeningar så låt oss gå igång hej alla här är och du tittar på.,Sweedish
och i den här videon ska jag ge dig 10 smarta ord för daglig användning och i slutet av den här videon.,Sweedish
Jag kommer också att ge dig ett smart tips för att låta riktigt flytande smart ordnummer.,Sweedish
en är översvämmad översvämmad betyder drunkning eller översvämning men översvämmad används ofta i samband med arbete som jag ' Jag är överbelastad med arbete jag har för mycket arbete att göra Jag har varit överbelastad med arbete hela veckan jag har knappt haft tid att andas nu låt oss titta på roten till detta ord.,Sweedish
träsk är en bit våtmark och om någon trampar på fel ställe i ett träsk kan de lätt drunkna och verbets form av träsk betyder att sjunka så här kan du använda detta ord.,Sweedish
låt oss säga att du har många uppdrag och att du har ett test som kommer och dina vänner kommer till dig och de säger.,Sweedish
hej varför hänger du inte med oss?,Sweedish
Du kan säga till dem jag är så ledsen men jag är överbelastad med arbete eller jag har överraskat några andra ord som du kan använda i stället för översvämmad är jag har för mycket att göra.,Sweedish
det finns för mycket på min tallrik som jag drunknar i jobbet.,Sweedish
jag är deluged med uppdrag smart ord nummer två är catch-22 nu är jag säker på att du ' Jag har hört detta ord innan catch-22 betyder en omöjlig situation där du inte kan göra en sak om du inte har gjort den andra och du inte kan göra den andra eftersom du inte har gjort den första har.,Sweedish
"Jag förvirrade dig, så låt mig ge dig några exempel, en situation med fångst-22 är när du inte får jobb utan att ha arbetslivserfarenhet.",Sweedish

mig så nästa gång du får matta läxor från skolan till exempel och om du har lämnat din mattebok i skolan så kan du berätta för dina vänner att du är i en riktig fix nu kanske du tror att ordet fix har något att göra med att reparera något.,Sweedish
men nej i en fix betyder att vara i en besvärlig situation andra ord som du kan använda istället för i en fix är att jag är i en soppa eller i ' m i en röra eller jag är i en plåga eller bara jag är i en plats smart ord nummer 7 är flummox flummox betyder att förvirra någon.,Sweedish

med sin enda dotter var narcisa marion extremt ödmjuk och söt narcisa men var helt tvärtom ser du att hon var vacker utöver ord hon var som en levande.,Sweedish
docka och den mest underhållande delen är att hon älskade sig själv utan syfte narcisa skulle du.,Sweedish
hjälp mig att baka brödet va inget sätt mamma mjölstädarna alla mina ljusa och glittrande ögon.,Sweedish
"narcisa skulle du hjälpa mig att plantera dessa frön, varför skulle jag göra det, vad har jag fått all smuts på mina vackra fingrar, värre om det skulle gå i ansiktet, det var problemet med narcisa.",Sweedish
hon tyckte sig vara för stor för att göra något arbete som många friare kom för att be om narcissus i äktenskapet.,Sweedish
eftersom hennes skönhet var känd vidsträckt men hon avvisade dem alla väldigt oförskämt varför skickade du bort dessa män igår de verkade trevliga du kan inte vara seriös mamma en av dem.,Sweedish
hade så små ögon nästan som en fågel och den andra hade en enorm näsa jag skulle inte vilja vara nära honom.,Sweedish
"när han nysade åh åh och sista stoppet nej, jag vill inte höra mer allt jag kunde se var att de här männen var riktigt trevliga min kära, du måste veta den skönheten.",Sweedish

min kära barn du är så vacker och vacker men du bryr dig inte om något annat än din skönhet.,Sweedish

det var en mycket egoistisk drömmamma du vet inte vad du säger att drömmen har fått mig att inse att jag behöver mat mycket större än den typ jag äter här hemma bröd av guld.,Sweedish
tänk bara på att den stackars narcissemamma var så orolig för sin dotter och hur.,Sweedish
hon skulle leva sitt liv den dagen två vänner kom för att besöka narcissmamma de var mellie och terry de tre av dem hade varit vänner i åldrar men terry och ellie hade en hemlighet båda.,Sweedish
"var magiska varelser något som narcisses mamma visste ingenting om terry melli oh det är så bra att se dig det har varit väldigt länge hasn ' t det hur har du varit jag har varit väldigt bra jag skulle ha varit bättre om bara om bara vad om bara min dotter narcisa var lite mer förstående marian berättade för mellie och terry allt om narcisa och hur hon var orolig för henne hon vill äta bröd av guld vad gör jag med henne, kanske om hennes dröm går i uppfyllelse.",Sweedish

åh dumt han är rik och stilig vad mer kan jag vilja ha terrence jag accepterar ditt förslag.,Sweedish
och med det gick hon in i vagnen och utan att ens säga adjö till sin mor åkte hon med ängeln när de färdade vagnen plötsligt in i en magisk portal där den reste genom ett stormigt område vagnen stötte enormt och narcissa.,Sweedish
var väldigt rädd oroa dig inte min kära allt detta kommer snart att vara över precis som han sa att vagnen gick genom en annan portal och nådde uppfarten.,Sweedish
"av ett stort och magnifikt gyllene slott narcisa blev förvånad över all den skönhet hon såg att jag visste att jag förtjänar så många rikedomar jag visste att du skulle vilja ha det du vill ha här hittar du från de vackraste klänningarna till de godaste matarna allt i mitt palats väl talar om mat jag är verkligen hungrig efter den åkturen jag ' m svälter kan jag få något av den goda maten naturligtvis här kött illaluktande melissa hon kommer att få dig vad du vill jag har hört så mycket om dig du stackars kära du är hungrig är du inte kommer vi går till matbordet och Jag ska skaffa dig lite mat åh tack, de gick in i matsalen och där på bordet fanns den mest häpnadsväckande maten som narcisa någonsin hade sett fantastisk, det beror på att det är sylt som görs.",Sweedish

"نيتشر (بالإنجليزية: Nature)‏ قد تعني:    تعديل - تعديل مصدري - تعديل ويكي بيانات ويكيبيديا (تلفظ ‎[wi:ki:bi:dija:]‏ وتلحن ‎[wikipi:dia]‏؛ تلفظ بالإنجليزية ‎/ˌwɪkiˈpi:di.ə/‏)[7] والكلمة مشتقة من مقطعين: ويكي wiki وتعني بلغة هاواي ""بالغ السرعة""، والثاني بيديا pedia ومشتق من كلمة موسوعة encyclopedia، ويكيبيديا هي موسوعة متعددة اللغات، مبنية على الويب، ذات محتوى حر، تشغلها مؤسسة ويكيميديا، التي هي منظمة غير ربحية.",Arabic
ويكيبيديا هي موسوعة يمكن لأي مستخدم تعديل وتحرير وإنشاء مقالات جديدة فيها.,Arabic
في مارس 2009 كان في ويكيبيديا 15 مليون مقالة تقريبًا، مكتوبة بما يقارب 292 لغة.,Arabic
في يوم 17 أغسطس، 2009: وصلت ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية لثلاثة ملايين مقالة.,Arabic
[8] تكتب المقالات تعاونيًا بواسطة متطوعين من حول العالم والغالبية العظمى من محتويات الموسوعة يمكن تعديلها بواسطة أي شخص يمتلك اتصالاً بالإنترنت.,Arabic
شهرة ويكيبيديا تنمو بثبات منذ بداية عملها.,Arabic
ويكيبيديا من الإنجليزية ويكيبيديا هي اختصار لكلمتين هما: ويكي بالإنجليزية Wiki (نوع من مواقع الويب التي يتم تحريرها جماعيا)، والكلمة الثانية هي بيديا من كلمة Encyclopedia والتي تعني بالعربية موسوعة.,Arabic
تنتشر خوادم ويكيبيديا الرئيسية في تامبا، فلوريدا، وخوادم أخرى موجودة في أمستردام وسيول.,Arabic
يعد ويكيبيديا من أشهر عشرة مواقع على الإنترنت على مستوى العالم.,Arabic
[9] نتيجة لطبيعة ويكيبيديا التي تسمح لأي مستخدم بتعديل مقالاتها، شكك النقاد والمحللون بها وتساءلوا عن مدى مصداقيتها ودقتها.,Arabic
[10][11] إذ أن بإمكان أي مستخدم أن يجري تعديلات على محتويات الموسوعة، تزيد احتمالية أن يضيف مجهولون أو مستخدمو الموسوعة المسجلون معلومات خاطئة أو غير مؤكدة، أو يقوم المخربون بحذف أقسام من مقالات أو إضافة تعليقات شخصية أو آراء متحيزة، خاصةً في المواضيع السياسية والدينية.,Arabic
أيضا تثار الشكوك حول حيادية المقالات في ويكيبيديا، ومدى دقة المعلومات الواردة بهذه المقالات.,Arabic
حدد القائمون على موسوعة ويكيبيديا مجموعة من السياسات والتعليمات التي يجب على مستخدمي الموسوعة الالتزام بها عند تحرير وتعديل محتويات الموسوعة، هذه السياسات تهدف إلى التصدي لمحاولات التخريب، وتحاول ضمان مصداقية المعلومات التي تحويها مقالات هذه الموسوعة.,Arabic
بدأ مشروع ويكيبيديا في 15 يناير 2001 كمتمم لمشروع نيوبيديا الذي يكتبه محررون خبراء.,Arabic
وبسبب بطء تطوّر نيوبيديا فقد قرّر جيمي ويلز ولاري سانجر أن ينشئا مشروعا مفتوحاً ليدعم نيوبيديا وهو ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
وأصبحت تحتوي على 600 ألف مقالة بالإنجليزية و2 مليون مقالة باللغات الأخرى مجتمعة حسب ما ذكر جيمي ويليز[7] اللغات الكبرى مثل الألمانية واليابانية والفرنسية واللغات الأوربية الغربية كبيرة أيضا، ثلث الزيارات فقط للإنجليزية على عكس ما يظن البعض، ومدى شهرة ويكيبيديا أنها من أكبر 50 موقعا في العالم وتعددت زيارات الصفحات زيارة صفحات النيويورك تيمز،[7] لدى نيويورك تيمز والمواقع الأخرى موظفين مسؤولين عن الموقع وهم كثيرين يتقاضون مرتبات، أما ويكيبيديا فيوجد واحد فقط وهو المطور للبرنامج نفسه وتم تعيينه منذ يناير 2005، والخوادم تتم إدارتها بواسطة متطوعين والتحرير يتم أيضا بواسطة متطوعين.,Arabic
تمت محاولة إنشاء موسوعات تعاونية أخرى عبر الإنترنت قبل ويكيبيديا، لكن لم يكن أي منها ناجحًا.,Arabic
[12] بدأت ويكيبيديا كمشروع تكميلي لـ نيوبيديا، وهو مشروع موسوعة مجاني باللغة الإنجليزية على الإنترنت كتب مقالاته خبراء وتمت مراجعته في إطار عملية رسمية.,Arabic
[13] تم تأسيسها في 9 مارس 2000، بملكية بوميس، وهي شركة بوابة إلكترونية.,Arabic
شخصياتها الرئيسية كانت الرئيس التنفيذي لشركة بوميس جيمي ويلز ولاري سانجر، رئيس تحرير نيوبيديا ولاحقًا ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
تم ترخيص نيوبيديا في البداية بموجب ترخيص نيوبيديا المحتوى الحر الخاص بها، ولكن حتى قبل تأسيس ويكيبيديا، تحولت نيوبيديا إلى ترخيص التوثيق المجاني GNU بناءً على طلب ريتشارد ستالمان.,Arabic
يرجع الفضل إلى ويلز في تحديد الهدف المتمثل في إنشاء موسوعة عامة قابلة للتحرير،   بينما يُنسب إلى سانجر استراتيجية استخدام الويكي للوصول إلى هذا الهدف.,Arabic
"[14] في 10 يناير 2001، اقترح سانجر على القائمة البريدية لـ نيوبيديا إنشاء ويكي كمشروع ""تغذية"" لـ نيوبيديا.",Arabic
[15] تم تسجيل النطاقات Wikipedia.com وWikipedia.org يوم 12 يناير 2001،[16] و13 يناير 2001،[17] على التوالي، وأطلقت ويكيبيديا في 15 كانون الثاني 2001،[13] كما في اللغة الإنجليزية واحدة طبعة في www.Wikipedia.com،  وأعلن عنها سانجر في القائمة البريدية لـ نيوبيديا.,Arabic
"تم تدوين سياسة ويكيبيديا الخاصة بـ ""وجهة نظر محايدة"" في الأشهر القليلة الأولى لها.",Arabic
بخلاف ذلك، كانت هناك قواعد قليلة نسبيًا في البداية وعملت ويكيبيديا بشكل مستقل عن نيوبيديا.,Arabic
في الأصل، كان بوميس ينوي جعل ويكيبيديا شركة من أجل الربح.,Arabic
[18] اكتسبت ويكيبيديا مساهمين مبكرين من نيوبيديا ومنشورات سلاش دوت وفهرسة محرك بحث الويب.,Arabic
كما تم إنشاء إصدارات اللغة، بإجمالي 161 طبعة بنهاية عام 2004.,Arabic
[19] تعايش نيوبيديا و ويكيبيديا حتى تم إزالة خوادم الأولى بشكل دائم في عام 2003، وتم دمج نصها في ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
تجاوزت ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية علامة مليوني مقال في 9 سبتمبر 2007، مما يجعلها أكبر موسوعة تم تجميعها على الإطلاق، متجاوزة موسوعة يونجل التي تم إجراؤها خلال عهد أسرة مينج عام 1408، والتي سجلت الرقم القياسي لما يقرب من 600 سنوات.,Arabic
نقلاً عن مخاوف من الإعلانات التجارية وعدم وجود سيطرة في ويكيبيديا، قام مستخدمو ويكيبيديا الإسبانية بالتشعب من ويكيبيديا لإنشاء الموسوعة الحرة بالإسبانية في فبراير 2002.,Arabic
[20] أعلن ويلز بعد ذلك أن ويكيبيديا لن تعرض إعلانات، وغيرت مجال ويكيبيديا من Wikipedia.com إلى Wikipedia.org.,Arabic
[21] على الرغم من أن ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية وصلت إلى ثلاثة ملايين مقال في أغسطس 2009، إلا أن نمو الطبعة، من حيث عدد المقالات الجديدة والمساهمين، يبدو أنه قد بلغ ذروته في أوائل عام 2007.,Arabic
[22] تمت إضافة حوالي 1800 مقال يوميًا إلى الموسوعة في عام 2006 ؛ بحلول عام 2013 كان هذا المتوسط حوالي 800.,Arabic
[23] عزا فريق في مركز بالو ألتو للأبحاث هذا التباطؤ في النمو إلى التفرد المتزايد للمشروع ومقاومته للتغيير.,Arabic
"[24] يقترح البعض الآخر أن النمو يتم تسويته بشكل طبيعي لأن المقالات التي يمكن تسميتها "" الفاكهة المتدلية "" - الموضوعات التي تستحق مقالًا بوضوح - قد تم إنشاؤها بالفعل وبنائها على نطاق واسع.",Arabic
[25][26][27] في نوفمبر 2009، وجد باحث في جامعة راي خوان كارلوس في مدريد أن ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية فقدت 49000 محرر خلال الأشهر الثلاثة الأولى من عام 2009؛ بالمقارنة، فقد المشروع 4900 محرر فقط خلال نفس الفترة من عام 2008.,Arabic
[28][29] استشهدت صحيفة وول ستريت جورنال بمجموعة من القواعد المطبقة على التحرير والنزاعات المتعلقة بمثل هذا المحتوى من بين أسباب هذا الاتجاه.,Arabic
[30] عارض ويلز هذه الادعاءات في عام 2009، نافياً التراجع وشكك في منهجية الدراسة.,Arabic
"[31] بعد ذلك بعامين، في عام 2011، أقرت ويلز بوجود انخفاض طفيف، مشيرة إلى انخفاض من ""أكثر بقليل من 36000 كاتب"" في يونيو 2010 إلى 35800 في يونيو 2011.",Arabic
"في المقابلة نفسها، زعم ويلز أيضًا أن عدد المحررين كان ""مستقرًا ومستدامًا"".",Arabic
"[32] شكك مقال عام 2013 بعنوان ""The Decline of ويكيبيديا"" في  إم آي تي تكنولوجي ريفيو هذا الادعاء.",Arabic
كشف المقال أنه منذ عام 2007، فقدت ويكيبيديا ثلث محرريها المتطوعين، وهؤلاء الذين ما زالوا هناك يركزون بشكل متزايد على التفاصيل.,Arabic
[33] في يوليو 2012، أفادت ذا أتلانتيك أن عدد المسؤولين في انخفاض أيضًا.,Arabic
"[34] في عدد 25 نوفمبر 2013 من مجلة نيويورك، صرحت كاثرين وارد أن ""ويكيبيديا، الموقع السادس الأكثر استخدامًا، يواجه أزمة داخلية"".",Arabic
[35] في كانون الثاني (يناير) 2007، دخلت ويكيبيديا لأول مرة قائمة العشرة الأوائل لمواقع الويب الأكثر شعبية في الولايات المتحدة، وفقًا لشبكات كوم سكور.,Arabic
مع 42.9 مليون زائر، احتلت ويكيبيديا المرتبة 9، متجاوزة نيويورك تايمز (رقم 10) وأبل (رقم 11).,Arabic
يمثل هذا زيادة كبيرة عن يناير 2006، عندما كانت المرتبة رقم 33، مع ويكيبيديا التي تلقت حوالي 18.3 مليون زائر.,Arabic
[36] اعتبارا من مارس 2020[تحديث]، ويكيبيديا تحتل المرتبة 13  بين المواقع من حيث الشعبية وفقًا لموقع أليكسا إنترنت.,Arabic
في عام 2014، تلقت ثمانية مليارات مشاهدة للصفحة كل شهر.,Arabic
"[37] في 9 فبراير 2014، ذكرت صحيفة نيويورك تايمز أن ويكيبيديا لديها 18 مليار مشاهدة للصفحة وما يقرب من 500 مليون زائر فريد شهريًا ""وفقًا لشركة التصنيف comScore"".",Arabic
"[38] يجادل لوفلاند وريجل بأن ويكيبيديا تتبع تقليدًا طويلًا من الموسوعات التاريخية التي تراكمت عليها تحسينات تدريجية من خلال ""التراكم الوصمي"".",Arabic
[39][40] في 18 يناير 2012، شاركت ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية في سلسلة من الاحتجاجات المنسقة ضد قانونين مقترحين في كونغرس الولايات المتحدة - قانون وقف القرصنة عبر الإنترنت (SOPA) وقانون حماية الملكية الفكرية (PIPA) - بحجب صفحاتها لمدة 24 ساعات.,Arabic
[41]  شاهد أكثر من 162 مليون شخص صفحة شرح التعتيم التي حلت محل محتوى ويكيبيديا مؤقتًا.,Arabic
"[42][43] في 20 كانون الثاني (يناير) 2014، أشارت تقارير سوبود فارما لصحيفة إيكونوميك تايمز إلى أنه لم يتوقف نمو ويكيبيديا فحسب، بل ""فقد ما يقرب من عشرة بالمائة من مشاهدات صفحاتها العام الماضي.",Arabic
كان هناك انخفاض بنحو ملياري شخص بين ديسمبر 2012 وديسمبر 2013.,Arabic
تتصدر نسخها الأكثر شيوعًا الشريحة: انخفضت مشاهدات صفحات ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية بنسبة اثني عشر بالمائة، وتراجعت تلك الخاصة بالنسخة الألمانية بنسبة 17 بالمائة وخسرت النسخة اليابانية تسعة بالمائة.,Arabic
"""[44] أضاف فارما أنه ""بينما يعتقد مديرو ويكيبيديا أن هذا قد يكون بسبب أخطاء في العد، يشعر خبراء آخرون أن مشروع Google رسم بياني معرفي الذي تم إطلاقه في العام الماضي قد يستحوذ على مستخدمي ويكيبيديا.",Arabic
"""[44] عند الاتصال بهذا الأمر، أشار كلي شيركي، الأستاذ المساعد في جامعة نيويورك والزميل في مركز بيركمان للإنترنت والمجتمع بجامعة هارفارد، إلى أنه يشتبه في أن الكثير من رفض عرض الصفحة يرجع إلى الرسوم البيانية المعرفية، قائلاً، ""إذا كان بإمكانك الحصول على سؤالك من صفحة البحث، فلست بحاجة إلى النقر فوق [المزيد].",Arabic
[44] بحلول نهاية ديسمبر 2016، احتلت ويكيبيديا المرتبة الخامسة في أكثر المواقع شعبية على مستوى العالم.,Arabic
[45] في يناير 2013، سميت ويكيبيديا 274301، كويكب، على اسم ويكيبيديا؛ في أكتوبر 2014، تم تكريم ويكيبيديا بنصب ويكيبيديا التذكاري؛ وفي يوليو 2015، أصبح 106 من 7473 700 مجلدًا من ويكيبيديا متاحًا كطباعة ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
في عام 2019، تم تسمية نوع من النباتات المزهرة فيولا ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
[46] في أبريل 2019، تحطمت مركبة هبوط إسرائيلية على سطح القمر، بيريشيت، وتحمل نسخة من جميع مقالات ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية تقريبًا منقوشة على ألواح رقيقة من النيكل؛ يقول الخبراء إن اللوحات ربما نجت من الانهيار [47][48] في يونيو 2019، أفاد العلماء أن جميع الـ 16 تم ترميز غيغابايت من نص المقالة من ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية في DNA اصطناعي.,Arabic
[49] على عكس الموسوعات التقليدية، تتبع ويكيبيديا مبدأ التسويف فيما يتعلق بأمان محتواها.,Arabic
لقد بدأ مفتوحًا بالكامل تقريبًا - يمكن لأي شخص إنشاء مقالات، ويمكن تحرير أي مقالة على ويكيبيديا بواسطة أي قارئ، حتى أولئك الذين ليس لديهم حساب على ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
سيتم نشر التعديلات على جميع المقالات على الفور.,Arabic
ونتيجة لذلك، يمكن أن تحتوي أي مقالة على معلومات غير دقيقة مثل الأخطاء والتحيزات الأيديولوجية والنص غير المنطقي أو غير ذي الصلة.,Arabic
نظرًا لتزايد شعبية ويكيبيديا، أدخلت بعض الإصدارات، بما في ذلك النسخة الإنجليزية، قيودًا على التحرير في بعض الحالات.,Arabic
على سبيل المثال، في ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية وبعض إصدارات اللغات الأخرى، يمكن للمستخدمين المسجلين فقط إنشاء مقال جديد.,Arabic
[50] على ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية، من بين صفحات أخرى، تمت حماية بعض الصفحات المثيرة للجدل أو الحساسة أو المعرضة للتخريب إلى حد ما.,Arabic
[51][52] مقال للتخريب في كثير من الأحيان يمكن أن تكون شبه محمية أو محمية بشكل كامل، وهذا يعني أنه ليس هناك سوى مستويات صلاحيات معينة حتى تستطيع تعديله.,Arabic
[53] قد يتم قفل مقال مثير للجدل بشكل خاص حتى يتمكن المسؤولون فقط من إجراء تغييرات.,Arabic
[54] في حالات معينة، يُسمح لجميع المحررين بإرسال تعديلات، لكن المراجعة مطلوبة لبعض المحررين، اعتمادًا على شروط معينة.,Arabic
"على سبيل المثال، تحتفظ ويكيبيديا الألمانية ""بنسخ ثابتة"" من المقالات،[55] التي اجتازت مراجعات معينة.",Arabic
"بعد التجارب المطولة والمناقشات المجتمعية، قدمت ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية نظام ""التغييرات المعلقة"" في ديسمبر 2012.",Arabic
[56] في ظل هذا النظام، تتم مراجعة تعديلات المستخدمين الجدد وغير المسجلين على بعض المقالات المثيرة للجدل أو المعرضة للتخريب من قبل المستخدمين المعروفين قبل نشرها.,Arabic
[57] على الرغم من عدم مراجعة التغييرات بشكل منهجي، فإن البرنامج الذي يشغل ويكيبيديا يوفر أدوات معينة تسمح لأي شخص بمراجعة التغييرات التي أجراها الآخرون.,Arabic
"ترتبط صفحة ""التاريخ"" الخاصة بكل مقالة بكل مراجعة.",Arabic
[note 1]  في معظم المقالات، يمكن لأي شخص التراجع عن تغييرات الآخرين بالنقر فوق ارتباط في صفحة محفوظات المقالة.,Arabic
"يمكن لأي شخص عرض أحدث التغييرات التي تم إجراؤها على المقالات، ويمكن لأي شخص الاحتفاظ "" بقائمة مراقبة"" للمقالات التي تهمه حتى يتم إخطاره بأي تغييرات.",Arabic
"""دورية الصفحات الجديدة"" هي عملية يتم من خلالها فحص المقالات المنشأة حديثًا بحثًا عن مشاكل واضحة.",Arabic
[58] في 2003، دكتوراه في الاقتصاد.,Arabic
"جادل الطالب أندريا سيفوليلي بأن تكاليف المعاملات المنخفضة للمشاركة في ويكي تخلق حافزًا للتطوير التعاوني، وأن ميزات مثل السماح بسهولة الوصول إلى الإصدارات السابقة من الصفحة تفضل ""البناء الإبداعي"" على ""التدمير الإبداعي"".",Arabic
[59] أي تغيير أو تعديل يتلاعب بالمحتوى بطريقة تضر بشكل مقصود بسلامة ويكيبيديا يعتبر تخريبًا.,Arabic
تشمل أكثر أنواع التخريب شيوعًا ووضوحًا إضافات البذاءة والفكاهة الفظة.,Arabic
يمكن أن يشمل التخريب أيضًا الإعلانات وأنواعًا أخرى من البريد العشوائي.,Arabic
أحيانًا يرتكب المحررون أعمال تخريب عن طريق إزالة المحتوى أو إفراغ صفحة معينة تمامًا.,Arabic
قد يكون من الصعب اكتشاف الأنواع الأقل شيوعًا من التخريب، مثل الإضافة المتعمدة لمعلومات معقولة ولكنها خاطئة إلى مقالة.,Arabic
يمكن للمخربين تقديم تنسيق غير ذي صلة، أو تعديل دلالات الصفحة مثل عنوان الصفحة أو تصنيفها، أو التلاعب بالشفرة الأساسية للمقالة، أو استخدام الصور بشكل معطل.,Arabic
من السهل بشكل عام إزالة التخريب الواضح من مقالات ويكيبيديا؛ متوسط الوقت اللازم لكشف التخريب وإصلاحه هو بضع دقائق.,Arabic
ومع ذلك، فإن بعض أعمال التخريب تستغرق وقتًا أطول لإصلاحها.,Arabic
في حادثة سيرة جون سيجنثالر، قدم محرر مجهول معلومات كاذبة في سيرة الشخصية السياسية الأمريكية جون سيجنثالر في مايو 2005.,Arabic
تم تقديم سيجنثالر كذباً كمشتبه به في اغتيال جون ف.,Arabic
كينيدي.,Arabic
بقي المقال غير مصحح لمدة أربعة أشهر.,Arabic
دعا سيجنثالر، مدير التحرير المؤسس لـ يو إس إيه توداي ومؤسس مركز التعديل الأول لمنتدى الحرية في جامعة فاندربيلت، جيمي ويلز المؤسس المشارك لـ ويكيبيديا وسأل عما إذا كان لديه أي طريقة لمعرفة من ساهم في المعلومات المضللة.,Arabic
رد ويلز بأنه لم يفعل ذلك، على الرغم من تعقب الجاني في النهاية.,Arabic
"[60][61] بعد الحادثة، وصف سيجنثالر ويكيبيديا بأنها ""أداة بحث معيبة وغير مسؤولة"".",Arabic
أدى هذا الحادث إلى تغييرات في السياسة في ويكيبيديا، استهدفت تحديدًا تشديد إمكانية التحقق من مقالات السيرة الذاتية للناس الأحياء.,Arabic
[62] في عام 2010، شجع دانيال توش مشاهدي برنامجه، توش.0، على زيارة مقال ويكيبيديا الخاص بالعرض وتحريره حسب الرغبة.,Arabic
في حلقة لاحقة، علق على التعديلات التي تم إجراؤها على المقالة، ومعظمها مسيئة، والتي تم إجراؤها من قبل الجمهور ودفعت إلى منع المقال من التحرير.,Arabic
[63][64] غالبًا ما يكون لدى مستخدمي ويكيبيديا نزاعات بشأن المحتوى، مما قد يؤدي إلى إجراء تغييرات متكررة معاكسة لمقالة، تُعرف باسم حرب التحرير.,Arabic
[65][66] العملية عبارة عن سيناريو مستهلك للموارد حيث لا يتم إضافة معرفة مفيدة.,Arabic
[67] تم انتقاد هذه الممارسة أيضًا على أنها تخلق ثقافة تحرير تنافسية[68] قائمة على الصراع[69] مرتبطة بأدوار الذكور التقليدية بين الجنسين،[70] مما يساهم في التحيز الجنساني على ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
يخضع المحتوى في ويكيبيديا للقوانين (على وجه الخصوص، قوانين حقوق النشر) للولايات المتحدة وولاية فيرجينيا الأمريكية، حيث توجد غالبية خوادم ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
"بعيدًا عن المسائل القانونية، تتجسد المبادئ التحريرية لويكيبيديا في ""خمس اعمده"" وفي العديد من سياسات وإرشادات تهدف إلى تشكيل المحتوى بشكل مناسب.",Arabic
حتى هذه القواعد مخزنة في شكل ويكي، ويقوم محررو ويكيبيديا بكتابة ومراجعة سياسات وإرشادات الموقع.,Arabic
[71] يمكن للمحررين تطبيق هذه القواعد عن طريق حذف أو تعديل المواد غير المتوافقة.,Arabic
في الأصل، استندت القواعد الخاصة بالإصدارات غير الإنجليزية من ويكيبيديا إلى ترجمة قواعد ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية.,Arabic
لقد تباعدوا منذ ذلك الحين إلى حد ما.,Arabic
[72] وفقًا للقواعد الموجودة في ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية، يجب أن يكون كل إدخال في ويكيبيديا حول موضوع موسوعي وليس إدخال قاموس أو نمط قاموس.,Arabic
"[73] يجب أن يفي الموضوع أيضًا بمعايير ويكيبيديا الخاصة بـ ""الملحوظة""،[74] مما يعني عمومًا أنه يجب تغطية الموضوع في وسائل الإعلام الرئيسية أو مصادر المجلات الأكاديمية الرئيسية المستقلة عن موضوع المقالة.",Arabic
علاوة على ذلك، تنوي ويكيبيديا نقل المعرفة التي تم تأسيسها ومعترف بها بالفعل.,Arabic
يجب ألا يقدم بحثًا أصليًا.,Arabic
الادعاء الذي من المحتمل أن يتم الطعن فيه يتطلب إشارة إلى مصدر موثوق.,Arabic
"بين محرري ويكيبيديا، غالبًا ما يتم التعبير عن هذا على أنه ""إمكانية التحقق، وليس الحقيقة"" للتعبير عن فكرة أن القراء، وليس الموسوعة، هم المسؤولون في النهاية عن التحقق من صحة المقالات وعمل تفسيراتهم الخاصة.",Arabic
[75] يمكن أن يؤدي هذا في بعض الأحيان إلى إزالة المعلومات التي، على الرغم من صحتها، لم يتم الحصول عليها بشكل صحيح.,Arabic
[76] أخيرًا، يجب ألا تنحاز ويكيبيديا إلى أي طرف.,Arabic
يجب أن تتمتع جميع الآراء ووجهات النظر، إذا كانت منسوبة إلى مصادر خارجية، بنصيب مناسب من التغطية داخل المقالة.,Arabic
يُعرف هذا باسم وجهة نظر محايدة (NPOV).,Arabic
مجموعة أخرى من المتطوعين هم الإداريون، البيروقراطيون، المضيفون، مدققو المستخدم، سفراء بين اللغات الأخرى لويكيبيديا... الإداريون هم مجموعة من المستخدمين الذين لهم ميزات خاصة.,Arabic
من هذه الميزات القدرة على حذف الصفحات واسترجاعها، حماية وإزالة حماية الصفحات ومنع المستخدمين من التحرير.,Arabic
تمول ويكيبيديا بواسطة مؤسسة ويكيميديا، في الربع الرابع من سنة 2005 تم صرف 321.000 دولار أمريكي على ويكيبيديا، 60% من المصروفات كانت على المكونات المادية.,Arabic
[77] تعتمد ويكيميديا على التبرعات بشكل أساسي.,Arabic
[78] بمرور الوقت، طورت ويكيبيديا عملية تسوية نزاع شبه رسمية للمساعدة في مثل هذه الظروف.,Arabic
"لتحديد إجماع المجتمع، يمكن للمحررين إثارة المشكلات في منتديات المجتمع المناسبة،[note 2] أو السعي للحصول على مدخلات خارجية من خلال طلب رأي ثالث أو عن طريق بدء مناقشة مجتمعية عامة تعرف باسم ""طلب التعليق"".",Arabic
مجلس التحكيم هو العملية النهائية لتسوية المنازعات.,Arabic
على الرغم من أن الخلافات تنشأ عادة من الخلاف بين رأيين متعارضين حول كيفية قراءة مقال ما، فإن لجنة التحكيم ترفض صراحة الحكم مباشرة على وجهة النظر المحددة التي ينبغي اعتمادها.,Arabic
تشير التحليلات الإحصائية إلى أن اللجنة تتجاهل محتوى النزاعات وتركز بدلاً من ذلك على طريقة إدارة النزاعات، لا تعمل كثيرًا لحل النزاعات وإحلال السلام بين المحررين المتضاربين، ولكن للتخلص من المحررين الذين يعانون من مشاكل مع السماح للمحررين المنتجين بالعودة للمشاركة.,Arabic
لذلك، لا تملي اللجنة محتوى المقالات، على الرغم من أنها تدين أحيانًا تغييرات المحتوى عندما ترى أن المحتوى الجديد ينتهك سياسات ويكيبيديا (على سبيل المثال، إذا تم اعتبار المحتوى الجديد متحيزًا).,Arabic
تشمل علاجاته التنبيهات (المستخدمة في 63% من الحالات) ومنع المحررين من تحرير المقالات (43%) أو الموضوعات (23%) أو ويكيبيديا (16%).,Arabic
عمومًا، يقتصر الحظر الكامل من ويكيبيديا على حالات انتحال الهوية والسلوك المعادي للمجتمع .,Arabic
عندما لا يكون السلوك انتحالًا للهوية أو معاديًا للمجتمع، ولكنه مخالف للإجماع أو ينتهك سياسات التحرير، تميل العلاجات إلى أن تقتصر على التحذيرات.,Arabic
"[79] كل مقال وكل مستخدم في ويكيبيديا له صفحة ""نقاش"" مرتبطة به.",Arabic
هذه تشكل قناة الاتصال الأساسية للمحررين للمناقشة والتنسيق والمناقشة.,Arabic
[80] تم وصف مجتمع ويكيبيديا بأنه مجموعة اجتماعية،[81] على الرغم من أنه ليس دائمًا مع دلالات سلبية تمامًا.,Arabic
"[82] تمت الإشارة إلى تفضيل المشروع للتماسك، حتى لو كان يتطلب حل وسط يتضمن تجاهل أوراق الاعتماد، على أنه "" معاداة النخبوية "".",Arabic
[83] أحيانًا ما يكافئ الويكيبيديون بأوسمة مقابل العمل الجيد.,Arabic
تكشف رموز التقدير الشخصية هذه عن مجموعة واسعة من الأعمال القيمة التي تمتد إلى ما هو أبعد من التحرير البسيط لتشمل الدعم الاجتماعي والإجراءات الإدارية وأنواع أعمال التعبير.,Arabic
[84] لا تتطلب ويكيبيديا من المحررين والمساهمين تقديم التعريف.,Arabic
"مع نمو ويكيبيديا، ""من يكتب ويكيبيديا؟"" أصبح أحد الأسئلة المتداولة حول المشروع.",Arabic
"[85] جادل جيمي ويلز ذات مرة بأن ""المجتمع ... مجموعة مكرسة من بضع مئات من المتطوعين ""تقدم الجزء الأكبر من المساهمات في ويكيبيديا، وبالتالي فإن المشروع يشبه إلى حد كبير أي منظمة تقليدية"".",Arabic
"[86] في عام 2008، ذكرت مقالة في مجلة Slate أن: ""وفقًا للباحثين في Palo Alto، فإن واحد بالمائة من مستخدمي ويكيبيديا مسؤولون عن حوالي نصف تعديلات الموقع"".",Arabic
[87] وقد اعترض آرون شوارتز على هذه الطريقة في تقييم المساهمات لاحقًا، حيث أشار إلى أن العديد من المقالات التي أخذ عينات منها تحتوي على أجزاء كبيرة من محتواها (تقاس بعدد الأحرف) التي ساهم بها المستخدمون الذين لديهم أعداد تحرير منخفضة.,Arabic
"[88] وجدت دراسة أجراها باحثون من كلية دارتموث عام 2007 أن ""المساهمين المجهولين وغير المتكررين في ويكيبيديا [...] هم مصدر موثوق للمعرفة مثل أولئك المساهمين الذين يسجلون في الموقع"".",Arabic
"[89] صرح جيمي ويلز في عام 2009 أنه ""[أنا] اتضح أن أكثر من 50% من جميع التعديلات تمت من قبل.7% فقط من المستخدمين... 524 شخصا.",Arabic
.,Arabic
.,Arabic
وفي الحقيقة، فإن أكثر 2% نشاطاً، أي 1400 شخص، قاموا بـ 73.4% من جميع التعديلات.,Arabic
"""[90] ومع ذلك، أظهر محرر بيزنس إنسايدر والصحفي هنري بلودجيت في عام 2009 أنه في عينة عشوائية من المقالات، يتم إنشاء معظم المحتوى في ويكيبيديا (يقاس بمقدار النص الذي تم المساهمة به حتى آخر تعديل للعينة) بواسطة ""الغيرالمسجليين""، في حين أن معظم عمليات التحرير ويتم التنسيق بواسطة ""المسجليين"".",Arabic
[90] وجدت دراسة أجريت في عام 2008 أن سكان ويكيبيديين كانوا أقل قبولًا وانفتاحًا وضميرًا من الآخرين،[91][92] على الرغم من أن التعليق اللاحق أشار إلى عيوب خطيرة، بما في ذلك أن البيانات أظهرت انفتاحًا أعلى وأن الاختلافات مع المجموعة الضابطة والعينات كانت صغيرة.,Arabic
"[93] وفقًا لدراسة أجريت عام 2009، هناك ""دليل على تزايد المقاومة من مجتمع ويكيبيديا للمحتوى الجديد"".",Arabic
[94] أظهرت العديد من الدراسات أن معظم المساهمين في ويكيبيديا هم من الذكور.,Arabic
والجدير بالذكر أن نتائج استطلاع مؤسسة ويكيميديا في عام 2008 أظهرت أن 13 في المائة فقط من محرري ويكيبيديا كانوا من الإناث.,Arabic
[95] لهذا السبب، حاولت الجامعات في جميع أنحاء الولايات المتحدة تشجيع الإناث على أن يصبحن مساهمات في ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
وبالمثل، فإن العديد من هذه الجامعات، بما في ذلك ييل وبراون، أعطت ائتمانًا جامعيًا للطلاب الذين قاموا بإنشاء أو تحرير مقالة تتعلق بالنساء في العلوم أو التكنولوجيا.,Arabic
"[96] كتب أندرو ليه، الأستاذ والعالم، في صحيفة نيويورك تايمز أن السبب وراء اعتقاده أن عدد المساهمين الذكور يفوق عدد الإناث إلى حد كبير هو أن التعريف على أنه امرأة قد تعرض نفسها ""لسلوك قبيح ومخيف"".",Arabic
[97] أظهرت البيانات أن الأفارقة ممثلون تمثيلا ناقصا بين محرري ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
"[98] توزيع 55٬723٬855 المقالات بإصدارات بلغات مختلفة (اعتبارًا من يناير 30, 2021)[99] يوجد حاليًا 313 إصدار لغة من ويكيبيديا.",Arabic
اعتبارًا من كانون الثاني (يناير) 2021، كانت المراكز الستة الأكبر، بترتيب عدد المقالات، هي ويكيبيديا English، وCebuano، وSwedish، وGerman، وFrench، وDutch.,Arabic
يدين ثاني وثالث أكبر مواقع ويكيبيديا إلى بوت Lsjbot الذي أنشأ المقالات، والذي أنشأ اعتبارًا من عام 2013 حوالي نصف المقالات في ويكيبيديا السويدية، ومعظم المقالات في  السيبوانية و ويكيبيديا واراي واراي.,Arabic
هذه الأخيرة هي لغتا الفلبين.,Arabic
"بالإضافة إلى المراكز الستة الأولى، هناك اثنا عشر موقعًا آخر في ويكيبيديا بها أكثر من مليون مقال (الروسية والإيطالية والإسبانية والبولندية والواراي والفيتنامية واليابانية والصينية والمصرية والعربية والبرتغالية والأوكرانية)، ستة أخرى بها أكثر من 500,000 مقالة (الفارسية والكتالونية والصربية والإندونيسية والنرويجية والكورية)، لدى 43 آخرين أكثر من 100,000، و 82 آخرون لديهم أكثر من 10000.",Arabic
أكبرها، ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية، لديها أكثر من 6.2 مليون مقال.,Arabic
اعتبارًا من يناير 2019، وفقًا لـ أليكسا، يتلقى المجال الفرعي الإنجليزي (en.wikipedia.org ؛ ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية) ما يقرب من 57% من حركة المرور التراكمية في ويكيبيديا، مع الانقسام المتبقي بين اللغات الأخرى (الروسية: 9%؛ الصينية: 6%؛ اليابانية: 6%؛ الإسبانية: 5%).,Arabic
وتعتمد ويكيبيديا على برنامج ميدياويكي، وهو برنامج ويكي مفتوح المصدر مرخص تحت رخصة جنو العمومية.,Arabic
مبني بلغة بي إتش بي، ويعتمد على قواعد بيانات ماي إس كيو إل.,Arabic
يقدم هذا البرنامج العديد من المزايا البرمجية، مثل الماكرو، والمتغيرات.,Arabic
يستخدم هذا البرنامج في ويكيبيديا ومشاريع ويكيميديا الأخرى بالإضافة إلى العديد من مواقع الويكي.,Arabic
تعمل خوادم ويكيبيديا بنظام جنو/لينكس.,Arabic
300 خادم في فلوريدا، 26 في أمستردام، و 23 في مركز استضافة شركة ياهو في سيول.,Arabic
"تتلقى خوادم ويكيبيديا من 20,000 إلى 45,000 طلب صفحة في الثانية، وهذا حسب الوقت في اليوم الواحد.",Arabic
"وصُفت ويكيبيديا بأنها ""مجهود لإنشاء وتوزيع موسوعة ذات أفضل جودة ممكنة لكل فرد على الكوكب بلغته الأم"".",Arabic
[100] في النصف الثاني من أغسطس 2009 كانت ويكيبيديا تصدر بأكثر من 260 لغة.,Arabic
"الإصدارات ال27 الأولى من حيث عدد المقالات كل واحدة منها يحتوي على أكثر من 100,000 مقالة، والـ174 الأولى تحتوي كل منها على أكثر من 1000 مقالة.",Arabic
[1] الآن تصدر ب301 لغة منها 291 لغة نشطة.,Arabic
لما كانت ويكيبيديا موسوعة متاحة عبر الويب، فهي موسوعة عالمية، وقد يستخدم المشاركون الذين يستخدمون نفس اللغة لهجات متباينة، أو ربما يأتون من بلاد مختلفة (هذه هي الحال في العديد من الويكيبيديات، منها الويكيبيديا الإنجليزية والصينية)، هذا قد يؤدي إلى اختلافات في التهجئة،[101] أو في وجهات النظر.,Arabic
يتلقى نطاق ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية 57% من مجموع زوار ويكيبديا، 16% لويكيبيديا الإسبانية، 4% لويكيبيديا الألمانية، ونفس النسبة لويكيبيديا اليابانية، أما ويكيبيديا العربية فتتلقى 1% من زوار ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
[102] يمكن للمحررين في إحدى موسوعات ويكيبيديا أن يترجموا المقالات من لغة إلى لغة أخرى، وهذا يلقى تشجيعاً في مجتمع ويكيبيديا (انظر:ويكيبيديا:ترجمة مقالات للعربية).,Arabic
المقالات الموجودة بأكثر من لغة يمكن ربطها بروابط إنترويكي، يمكن ملاحظة هذه الروابط في قائمة في الجانب الأيمن من صفحة المقال.,Arabic
الصور والوسائط المتعددة الأخرى يتم تشاركها من خلال مشروع ويكيميديا كومنز.,Arabic
جملة من الانتقادات التي وجهت لويكيبيديا، منذ نشأتها: بسبب طريقة تحرير المقالات من خلال نظام الويكي الذي يسمح لأي شخص إضافة وتعديل وحذف معلومات من معظم مقالات ويكيبيديا، اتهم بعض المتخصصين الويكي، بكونها ليست ذات مرجعية.,Arabic
عبارة: نص ضعيف بمصدر، أفضل من كتابة جيدة غير موثوقة، تدل على أن المحررين المجهولين، لا يمكن تتبعهم، أو مناقشتهم، للاستفادة منهم، أو لمجادلتهم.,Arabic
يجيب إداريو الويكي، أن هذا يشجع الزوار الجدد على الإضافة، بإغرائهم للتغيير، والاستفادة ولو بتلميحات عديدة منهم، كما أنه غالباً ما يدفع هؤلاء المحررين للتسجيل في آخر المطاف.,Arabic
كما أن دراسات لتأثير التخريب، أثبتت أنه لا داعي في المبالغة بتأثيره، غالباً، ما تكون المقالات المحايدة، أطول مدة وأكثر استقرارا.,Arabic
إن مختلف صلاحيات إداريي الويكي، تمكنهم من حماية المقالات التي تحتاج مراقبة مكثفة، أو تتعرض لتخريب متنوع، كمقالات البلدان مثلا، أو المقالات عن المواضيع الدينية والسياسية.,Arabic
لا يوفر كل المساهمين مصادر لكتاباتهم، طبيعة عمل ويكيبيديا هذه جعلتها موضعاً للشك في مصداقية محتوياتها؛.,Arabic
[103] أجرى خبراء جامعيون أستراليون دراسة حول ويكيبيديا وطريقة تحرير المقالات فيها، ووجدوا أن مواضيع ويكيبيديا يحررها أعضاء يتعاونون فيما بينهم، وهم غالباً من غير المتخصصين.,Arabic
لكن أيضاً وجدوا أن لطريقة الويكي هذه بعض المميزات للموسوعة.,Arabic
[104][105] كما أن كتاب الويكي ليسوا كلهم ذوي اختصاص، من سن الطفولة، إلى الكهولة.,Arabic
يُنصح لهذا بقراءة الويكي دائما بنظرة ناقدة.,Arabic
لدى الإداريين الحق في مسح أية مساهمات غير موثوقة بمصادر تضمن حياديتها، ومصداقيتها.,Arabic
"تتضمن المعلومات التي تقدمها ويكيبيديا حول العلوم، والانتقادات والجدال حول تأثير وجودة المعلومات وثقافة محرري ويكيبيديا، العلماء، وغير المتخصصين في إدخال المعلومات إلى ويكيبيديا في عام 2016 في مؤسسة ويكيبيديا التعليمية  ومؤسسة سيمونس تم تقديم برنامج يسمى ""عام العلوم"" في هذا البرنامج، حيث قام معلموا الويكيبيديا بزيارة المعارض العلمية ودعوا العلماء للمساهمة بمعلومات في مجالهم وتخصصهم في ويكيبيديا.",Arabic
بعض الجامعات لديها برنامج يشجع الطلاب على تعديل مقالات ويكيبيديا العلمية كجزء من تجربتهم العلمية ويدعو مجتمع ويكيبيديا العديد من الأكادميين لتحرير مقالات ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
أيضا قام العديد من الأكادميين الإجتماعيين بتشجيع الأفراد على تحرير ويكيبيديا.,Arabic
في دراسة عام2005 نشرت في مجلة نيتشر تم إجراء مقارنة بين 40 مقالة  علمية من الويكيبيديا الإنجليزية وبين موسوعة بريتانيكا، وجد الخبراء أربع مشاكل جدية في كل من  الويكيبيديا وموسوعة بريتانيكا، ووجدوا أيضاً 162 مشكلة أقل جدية في ويكيبيديا و123 مشكلة أقل جدية في  بريتانيكا.,Arabic
مجلة أدبيات علمية كتبت لVice تشتكي في عام 2017 أن مقالات ويكيبيديا العلمية تقنية بشكل كبير.,Arabic
كما انتقد وشكك العديد من العلماء والتنظيمات الإعلامية بمحتوى مقالات كل من الموسوعتين من ناحية التأثير العلمي، والنقاشات المتعلقة بالعلوم.,Arabic
بالإضافة إلى ويكيبيديا أطلقت مؤسسة ويكيميديا العديد من المشاريع سميت بالمشاريع الشقيقة، ويكي قاموس مشروع قاموس متعدد اللغات بدأ في ديسمبر 2002، ويكي اقتباس الذي يضم مجموعة من الاقتباسات، ويكي الكتب مشروع للكتب المجانية الحرة التي يتم تحريرها تعاونياً.,Arabic
ويكيميديا تطلق مشاريع عديدة منذ ذلك الحين.,Arabic
[111] أحدث مشاريع ويكيميديا هو ويكي جامعة مشروع يهدف إلى دعم التعليم الحر واستضافة مصادر تعليمية مجانية.,Arabic
مشاريع أخرى مستقلة عن مؤسسة ويكيميديا استوحت الفكرة من طريقة عمل ويكيبيديا التي تعتمد على نظام الويكي والعمل الجماعي، من هذه المشاريع، موسوعة المعرفة، وموسوعة الحياة.,Arabic
كما إستوحت موسوعة لاروس طريقة عمل ويكيبيديا لإنشاء موسوعة على الإنترنت يحررها مساهمون غير متخصصين، لكن مع اختلاف في التطبيق فموسوعة لاروس تسمح لمستخدمها أن يكتب مقالاً ويحق له وحده أن يحرره، وهذا النموذج يتفق مع ما تطبقه خدمة نول من جوجل.,Arabic
"[112] الفيلم الوثائقي المستقل الأول عن ويكيبيديا يسمى ""الحقيقة بالأرقام: قصة ويكيبيديا"" Truth in Numbers: The ويكيبيديا Story) عرض في مؤتمر ويكيمانيا 2010.",Arabic
تم تصويره في العديد من قارات العالم.,Arabic
سجل الفيلم تاريخ ويكيبيديا وقدم مقابلات مع العديد من محرري ويكيبيديا حول العالم والآراء المتباينة حولها.,Arabic
"[113] تعلم الآلة (بالإنجليزية: Machine Learning)‏ هو أحد فروع الذكاء الاصطناعي التي تهتم بتصميم وتطوير خوارزميات وتقنيات تسمح للحواسيب بامتلاك خاصية ""التعلم"".",Arabic
بشكل عام هناك مستويين من التعلم: الاستقرائي والاستنتاجي.,Arabic
يقوم الاستقرائي باستنتاج قواعد وأحكام عامة من البيانات الضخمة.,Arabic
المهمة الأساسية للتعلم الآلي هو استخراج معلومات قيمة من البيانات، بالتالي هو قريب جدا من التنقيب في البيانات (بالإنجليزية: data mining)‏ والإحصاء والمعلوماتية النظرية.,Arabic
[1][2] يستخدم التعلم الآلي في العديد من المجالات من الهندسة إلى الطب.,Arabic
[2][3][4] يتضمن التعلم الآلي عدداً كبيراً من حقول التطبيقات: معالجة اللغات الطبيعية (بالإنجليزية: natural language processing)‏ وتمييز الأنماط (بالإنجليزية: syntactic pattern recognition)‏ ومحركات البحث (بالإنجليزية: search engines)‏ والتشخيص الطبي والمعلوماتية الحيوية والمعلوماتية الكيميائية، تصنيف تسلسلات الدنا، تمييز الكلام (بالإنجليزية: speech recognition)‏ وتمييز الكتابة handwriting recognition، وحتى تمييز الأشياء (بالإنجليزية: object recognition)‏، رؤية الحاسوب (بالإنجليزية: computer vision)‏ الألعاب الإستراتيجية وتحريك الروبوت (بالإنجليزية: robot locomotion)‏.,Arabic
"تم استخدام مصطلح ""التعلم الآلي"" لأول مرة في عام 1959 من قبل آرثر صموئيل، وهو أمريكي عمل في شركة آي بي إم.",Arabic
[5] في الستينيات ، كان التعلم الآلي يستخدم في الغالب لتصنيف الأنماط.,Arabic
قد وفَر توم م.,Arabic

نحن جميعًا نبحث عن طرق سريعة لنصبح أكثر طلاقة في اللغة الإنجليزية ، وأنا أعلم أنني أفهم ما يحدث هو أن هناك بضع كلمات تدور حول عقولنا ونحتاج إلى إجراء هذه المحادثة بأكملها باستخدام رائع رائع رائع أو ملحمي ، فما رأيك في ذلك؟ تعلم بعض الكلمات الإنجليزية الجديدة والذكية التي يمكنك استخدامها في حياتك اليومية ورفع مفرداتك في دقائق.",Arabic
لذلك سوف نتعلم اليوم 10 كلمات ذكية جديدة معانيها ، كلمات جذرية وجمل أمثلة لذلك دعونا نبدأ كل من هذا وأنتم تشاهدون.,Arabic
وفي هذا الفيديو سأعطيك 10 كلمات ذكية للاستخدام اليومي وفي نهاية هذا الفيديو.,Arabic
سأقدم لك أيضًا تلميحًا ذكيًا لجعل رقم الكلمات الذكية بطلاقة حقًا.,Arabic
الشخص غارق في الغرق يعني الغرق أو الفيضان ولكن غالبًا ما يستخدم في سياق العمل مثل أنا غارق في العمل لدي الكثير من العمل الذي يجب القيام به ، لقد غمرني العمل هذا الأسبوع بالكامل ، لقد كان لدي وقت بالكاد للتنفس الآن دعنا ننظر إلى جذر هذه الكلمة.,Arabic
المستنقع عبارة عن قطعة من الأراضي الرطبة وإذا خطا شخص ما في المكان الخطأ في مستنقع يمكن أن يغرق بسهولة وصيغة الفعل من المستنقع تعني الغرق ، لذا إليك كيفية استخدام هذه الكلمة.,Arabic
لنفترض أن لديك الكثير من المهام ولديك اختبار قادم وسيأتي أصدقاؤك إليك ويقولون لك.,Arabic
مرحباً ، لماذا لا تتسكع معنا ، يمكنك أن تقول لهم إنني آسف جدًا ولكني غارق في العمل أو أنني غارق في بعض الكلمات الأخرى التي يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الغرق ، هل لدي الكثير لكى يفعل.,Arabic
هناك الكثير على لوحي أنا غارق في العمل.,Arabic
أنا غارق في المهام ، الكلمة الذكية الثانية هي catch-22 الآن أنا متأكد من أنك لقد سمعت هذه الكلمة قبل catch-22 تعني موقفًا مستحيلًا لا يمكنك فيه فعل شيء ما لم تفعل الآخر ولا يمكنك فعل الآخر لأنك لم تفعل الشيء الأول.,Arabic
لقد أربكتك ، لذا اسمح لي أن أقدم لك بعض الأمثلة على أن حالة الالتقاط هي عندما لا تحصل على وظيفة دون أن يكون لديك خبرة في العمل.,Arabic
لكن لا يمكنك الحصول على الخبرة حتى تحصل على وظيفة ، وقد صاغ جوزيف هيلر 22 في كتابه الشهير الذي يحمل نفس الاسم catch-22 عندما كان يصف بعض القواعد المتناقضة التي كانت تنطبق على الجنود خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية.,Arabic
مثال آخر على catch-22 هو أنك بحاجة إلى قرض مصرفي لأنك لا تملك ما يكفي.,Arabic
نقودًا ولكنك لن تحصل على هذا القرض المصرفي ما لم تثبت للبنك أن لديك ما يكفي من المال ، لذا تذكر في المرة القادمة التي تواجه فيها موقفًا صعبًا.,Arabic
لاستخدام كلمة catch-22.,Arabic
واحصل على هذه النظرات المثيرة للإعجاب من أصدقائك ، وكلمات أخرى يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من catch-22 هي مفارقة أو معضلة كلمة ذكية.,Arabic
رقم ثلاثة هو رقيق رقيق رقيق يعني أن تكون متطورًا لتكون مهذبًا ومتوازنًا ورائعًا.,Arabic
"كلمة ""رقيق"" لها أصول عديدة ومختلفة ولكن مصدر واحد مثير للاهتمام للكلمة وهو ما يعني اللطيف أو المذاق الحلو.",Arabic
إنه متوازن ولطيف للغاية خاصة أمام السيدات أو أن باراك أوباما لطيف للغاية ولطيف الآن تذكر عندما تكون في حفلة في المرة القادمة وترى هذا الشخص الذي هو كذلك.,Arabic
مهذب ومثقف ومتطور.,Arabic
لا تنسى أن تقول ، من هو ذلك الرجل اللطيف الموجود في الزاوية ، باستخدام هذه الكلمة سوف يصنع مفرداتك على الفور.,Arabic
رقيق للغاية ، كلمة ذكية رقم أربعة فظيعة ، وكلمة فظيعة تعني شيئًا سيئًا فظيعًا فظيعًا مروعًا وحشيًا مروعًا له جذر لاتيني يسمى.,Arabic
مما يعني الخوف القاسي أو الرهيب بعض الأمثلة على كلمة فظيعة هي حوادث الاغتصاب الأخيرة في دلهي كانت فظيعة أو يتم معاملة السجناء.,Arabic
بطريقة فظيعة أحيانًا في السجون الفظيعة تستخدم أيضًا في الحياة اليومية للحديث عن بعض الأعمال الخاطئة الشائعة وتريد المبالغة فيها.,Arabic
على سبيل المثال ، كانت آداب المائدة فظيعة أو أن إحساسها بالملابس فظيع جدًا أو قواعده فظيعة لذلك في المرة القادمة التي تسمع فيها عن عمل مروع في الأخبار تذكر ذلك.,Arabic
ملاحظة ويقولون إن هذا عمل فظيع.,Arabic
الكلمة الذكية رقم 5 هي هائلة ، ورائعة ، ورائعة ، وتعني مذهلًا مذهلاً.,Arabic
"الآن غالبًا ما نستخدم كلمة رائع هنا "" كلمة أخرى يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من كلمة رائعة ، على سبيل المثال ، حصلت اليوم على درجة هائلة في اختباري مما يعني أنني حصلت على درجة عالية جدًا أو.",Arabic
حصلت على درجة شبه مثالية ، فكلمة stupendous لها جذور لاتينية كلاسيكية من الكلمة التي تعني.,Arabic
يتم استخدام أن تكون مذهولًا للغاية لوصف شيء جيد بشكل مذهل ، على سبيل المثال تبدو رائعة في هذا الفستان أو ما هو منظر رائع من هذه الشرفة أو أنا أقرأ هذا الكتاب الرائع الذي لا يمكنني أن أخفيه ماذا عنك يخبار.,Arabic
أصدقاؤك هذه القناة الرائعة للطلاب وبعض الكلمات الأخرى التي يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الهائلة هي رائعة بشكل لا يصدق أو جيدة بشكل استثنائي ، لذا قبل أن نتابع الكلمات الخمس المتوازنة في هذا الفيديو ، تذكر أن تضع تعليقًا أسفل هذا الفيديو.,Arabic
أن تخبرني أيًا من هذه الكلمات العشر كانت كلمتك الذكية المفضلة رقم ستة في الإصلاح في الإصلاح يعني أن تكون في موقف مزعج ، على سبيل المثال يا فتى أنا في حالة إصلاح لأنني وضعت خططًا مع صديقين مختلفين لهذا مساء.,Arabic
لقد فقدت هاتفي وأنا في إصلاح أو تعطلت حافلتنا هذا الصباح وأنا في إصلاح يلجأ صديقي دائمًا إلي للحصول على المساعدة عندما يكون في إصلاح وعندما يكون الذهاب جيدًا ينسى ذلك.,Arabic
أنا ، لذا في المرة القادمة التي تحصل فيها على واجب الرياضيات المنزلي من المدرسة على سبيل المثال ، وإذا تركت كتاب الرياضيات في المدرسة ، فيمكنك إخبار أصدقائك أنك في حل حقيقي الآن ، فقد تعتقد أن كلمة الإصلاح لها ما تفعله بإصلاح شيء ما.,Arabic
ولكن ليس في الإصلاح يعني أن تكون في موقف مزعج ، وبكلمات أخرى يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الإصلاح ، هل أنا في حساء أو أنا m في حالة من الفوضى أو أنا في مكان مزعج أو أنا فقط في مكان ما ، الكلمة الذكية رقم 7 هي flummox flummox تعني إرباك شخص ما.,Arabic
لدرجة أنهم نسوا ما يجب عليهم فعله الآن.,Arabic
عند انعكاسه في المرآة أو كان السائح في حيرة من أمره بسبب العادات المختلفة التي.,Arabic
لقد واجهته أثناء رحلاته أو في مقابلة عندما سُئلت عن سبب تعيينك ، بدت محيرة تمامًا في المرة القادمة إذا كنت مرتبكًا بشأن أي أسئلة على سبيل المثال في امتحان فأنت.,Arabic
يمكن أن أقول ذلك دائمًا لأنني لم لقد استعدت جيدًا للامتحان ، لقد شعرت بالحيرة من بعض الأسئلة ، الكلمات الأخرى التي يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الحيرة هي محيرة أو محيرة الكلمة الذكية رقم ثمانية هي موعد موعد التقاء.,Arabic
هي طريقة فرنسية جدًا لقول لقاء أو موعد ، على سبيل المثال ، لدي موعد مع أصدقائي على الغداء يوم السبت أو أخطط للقاء أصدقائي في المركز التجاري ، حيث يمكن استخدام موعد الأفلام كاسم أو كفعل فمثلا.,Arabic
لدي موعد مع أصدقائي هذا المساء أو سألتقي مع أصدقائي غدًا.,Arabic
في وقت سابق في فرنسا ، استخدم الجيش موعدًا للإشارة إلى مكان اجتماع للقوات ، والآن هناك شيء مثير وسري بعض الشيء حول كلمة التقاء حتى الآن ، بينما يمكنك استخدام موعد لأي اجتماع.,Arabic
بشكل عام لكنها فازت قد يكون مناسبًا جدًا لعقد اجتماع رسمي ، لذا إذا كان لديك تاريخ ، فربما يمكنك بالتأكيد الاتصال بأن كلمة التقاء الذكية رقم 9 منفرجة ومنفرجة المنفرجة إهانة ستستخدمها عندما تحاول الاتصال بشخص ما غبي أو غير ذكي.,Arabic
لقد سمعت الآن كلمة منفرجة في الهندسة الزاوية المنفرجة والزاوية الحادة ، لذا فإن الزاوية المنفرجة هي زاوية أكبر من 90 درجة ولكنها أقل من 180 درجة.,Arabic
والزاوية الحادة هي هذه الزاوية الحادة التي تقل عن 90 درجة حادة جدًا حيث يتم استخدام كلمة للدلالة على حاد وبالتالي أيضًا حادة عقليًا ومنفرجة تدل على فظة ، وبالتالي فهي بطيئة بعض الشيء في العقل ، لذا فإن الجمل المنفرجة هي الرجل كان بليدًا لدرجة أنه أعطى كلمة المرور الخاصة به إلى متصل مزيف أو طفل منفرج.,Arabic
لم يكن قادرا.,Arabic
للإجابة على سؤال واحد في الاختبار أو واجه الرجل المنفرج صعوبة في فهم التعليمات الأساسية ، افترض الآن في وضعك في الحياة اليومية أن صديقك أو صديقتك غاضب منك ولا تعرف لماذا يمكنك ذلك.,Arabic
قل لهم ربما أكون منفرجًا ولكني لا أعرف لماذا أنت مستاء للغاية ، فالكلمة الذكية رقم 10 هي بطيئة بطيئة بطيئة تعني أن تتحرك بطريقة بطيئة لتكون بطيئًا نوعًا ما.,Arabic
من المعتاد أن تبدو متعبًا ومفتقدًا.,Arabic
في مثال الطاقة ، وجبة غداء ثقيلة تجعلني في فترة ما بعد الظهيرة بطيئًا لها جذور من الكلمة التي تعني شخصًا بطيئًا ، والسلج هو حيوان يتحرك ببطء شديد مثل أمثلة الحلزون.,Arabic
كان الاقتصاد بطيئًا جدًا هذا العام أو تعافى بعد بداية بطيئة.,Arabic
أو كان العمل بطيئًا هذا الربع ، يمكنك استخدامه في حياتك اليومية إذا كنت تشعر بالتعب الشديد يومًا ما يمكنك إخبار والدتك أو يمكنك معرفة ذلك.,Arabic
أصدقاؤك أشعر بالكسل الشديد.,Arabic
اليوم يمكنني أن أفعل مع مشروب طاقة.,Arabic
الكلمات الأخرى التي يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الكسل يمكن أن تكون خاملة أو تسحب قدمي ، لذا كانت هذه الكلمات العشر الذكية وقبل ذلك.,Arabic
أعطيك هذه النصيحة السرية لتبدو بطلاقة للغاية وأريد أن أذكرك أنه في.,Arabic
إذا كنت تبحث عن كلمات ذكية لاستخدامها في مكالمة هاتفية ، فأنا أضع رابطًا لمقطع فيديو.,Arabic
في مربع الوصف لذلك ، والآن النصيحة السرية للتحدث بطلاقة هي عدم استخدام أكثر من كلمة أو جملة ذكية أعرفها في بعض الأحيان.,Arabic
نحن متحمسون جدا لأن.,Arabic
نحن' لقد تعلمنا الكثير من هذه الكلمات الذكية ونميل إلى كتابة اثنين وثلاثة أربعة منها في جملة واحدة لا تبدو طبيعية.,Arabic

يمكنك أن تقول آسف لإزعاجك تعلم أنك ترى.,Arabic
شخص ما مشغول ، يمكنك دائمًا أن تقول آسف لإزعاجك ثم يمكنك المضي قدمًا والسؤال.,Arabic
آسف لإزعاجك.,Arabic
إذا كنت في وسط شيء ما في شخص ما ' أسألك شيئًا يمكنك قوله ، أنت في منتصف شيء ما وشخص ما يطلب منك شخص ما أن تفعل شيئًا تقوله ، أنا آسف.,Arabic
سأكون معك بعد دقيقة وسأكون معك ومن ثم تستأنف القيام بشيء ما وتقول أين كنا.,Arabic
مثل متى توقفنا عن مكان وجودنا وعليك تكراره لأنه الصوت الذي يخطئ به شخص ما.,Arabic
لذا فهذه طريقة رائعة للتدرب على أين كنا مرة أخرى إذا كنت في منتصف محادثة؟ ولم تفهم ما كان يقوله الشخص الآخر ، يمكنك أن تقوله بعلامة استفهام.,Arabic
ما يعني الذي يدفع الشخص للتكرار مرة أخرى؟ كنت تقول .,Arabic
إذا حصل شخص ما على وظيفة أحلامه في كل ما يمكنك قوله محظوظًا أو دخل أي شخص إلى الجامعة ، فإن أحلامه مثل محظوظ ، فهذه طريقة لتهنئة الشخص المحظوظ أو مجرد التأكيد على أنه محظوظ لك بطريقة أخرى إن كنت غاضبًا حقًا هو أن أقول إنني شعرت بالخوف كما لو كنت غاضبًا جدًا.,Arabic
أوه ، هذا جنوني تقريبًا.,Arabic
لقد أخافت عبارة أخرى يستخدمها المتحدثون الأصليون مفيدة لك ويمكن أن يكون هذا إيجابيًا وسلبيًا عندما تقول إنني حصلت على ترقية وإذا قالوا جيدًا لك ، فأحب التهنئة وأحيانًا إذا قلت أنني سأغادر هذا المكان.,Arabic
إنها جيدة بالنسبة لك ، سيكون أفضل بدونك وهذا معنى سلبي ، لذا استمع حقًا إلى التنغيم.,Arabic
إذا فاجئك شيء ما ، يمكنك أيضًا أن تقول إنه يجب أن تمزح معي مثل يا إلهي.,Arabic
لا أستطيع أن أصدق أنه يجب عليك أن تمزح لي أن تخبر أحدًا أن يبتسم ولكي تكون سعيدًا يمكنك دائمًا أن تقول ابتهج ابتهج.,Arabic
إذا كنت تريد شخصًا يبدو وكأنه يبكي ويشكو من شيء لا يحدث ، يمكنك أن تقول تعال ، هل يمكنك فعل ذلك أنا؟ هيا.,Arabic
يمكنك القيام بذلك ، يمكنك تمرير التوفل ، يمكنك تمرير gmat التي ستحصل عليها.,Arabic
يمكنك القيام بذلك إذا كان هناك شخص ما يقوم بعمل جيد حقًا ، يمكنك إخبارهم بمواصلة العمل الجيد ، واستمر في العمل الجيد مثل أن تكون جيدًا مثلك واستمر في العمل الجيد ، استمر في أن تكون عبارة أخرى عامية ، وهذا ما يفعله الأمريكيون قل.,Arabic
هذا مضاء مما يعني أن الكثير من الأمريكيين قالوا إن هذا مذهل في كاليفورنيا أوه هذا مضاء وربما سمعته في الأغاني التي يضيء إذا كان شخص ما ناجحًا بعد الفشل ، لذلك يمكنك أن تقول هناك تذهب ، أخبرتك أنك ستصل إلى هناك تذهب إذا سألك شخص ما إذا كنت متعبًا وتريد أن تقول أنك لست متعبًا على الإطلاق لا أستطيع أن أقول لا قليلا ناه.,Arabic
أريد أن أستمر ، لست متعبًا من ذلك عندما يسألك أحدهم ، هل أنت متأكد وأنت متأكد تمامًا من أنه لا يوجد مكان لذلك؟ لا يوجد مجال للشك في أمريكا إذا كنت تريد إرسال رسالة نصية إلى شخص ما أو إرسال رسالة تقولها نصًا إلى نص ، لذلك سأرسل لك رسالة نصية تعني أنني سأرسل لك رسالة عبر whatsapp أو برقية أو رسول مهما كان ما سأستخدمه أرسل لك رسالة نصية مرة أخرى لتشجيع شخص ما لتخبره ألا ينزعج ، يمكنك القول إن الأمر لا يستحق ذلك مثل لماذا تبكي؟ لا يستحق كل هذا العناء.,Arabic
"أنت أفضل بكثير من المشكلة التي تبكي عليها "" لا تستحق دموعك.",Arabic
لا يستحق كل هذا العناء ، أنا شخصياً أحب العبارة التي تعني أنك رائع.,Arabic
يا إلهي.,Arabic
أنت صخرة لا ، لقد قمت بعمل رائع.,Arabic
إذا كان شخص ما لا يعمل بشكل جيد حقًا ، وتريد منه أن يعمل بجدية أكبر ، يمكنك أن تقول إنه يجب عليك أن تمضي مسافة إضافية مما يعني أنه مثل العمل بجدية أكبر ، يجب أن تقطع ميلًا إضافيًا.,Arabic
طريقة أخرى لقول نفس الشيء تمامًا يمكنك أن تقوله صعد لعبتك مثل العمل بجد والعمل بشكل أفضل تصعيد لعبتك.,Arabic
إذا كان هناك من يبكي ولا يريد ذلك.,Arabic
إنها تغرق وتقول إنها تجمع بين نفسك مثل خذ نفسك حرفيًا واجمع نفسك معًا ، توقف عن العمل ، توقف عن البكاء ، اجمع نفسك معًا.,Arabic
مهلا تهدئة نفسك معا عبارة أخرى.,Arabic
أحبك بعتني لأن الناس في بعض الأحيان يصفون رحلتهم أو شخص اشتروه ويصفون أنه جيد جدًا.,Arabic
وهم يشبهونني أريد أن أشتري نفس الشيء وأقول لهم إنك بعتني بعتني لن أشتري هذا جيدًا ، لقد بعتني إذا لم تكن مهتمًا بالمحادثة.,Arabic
أنت تحب الجلوس ، يمكنك القول أنني لا أستطيع أن أهتم كثيرًا ، فهذا ممل جدًا.,Arabic
أنا لست مهتم.,Arabic
لا يمكنني أن أقلل من اهتمامك إذا سألك أحدهم شيئًا وهذا قرار سهل حقًا بالنسبة لك كما يخبرك أحدهم بأنك تأخذ مليون دولار وتقول إن هذا أمر غير منطقي.,Arabic
أنا سأخذه.,Arabic
هذا أمر لا يحتاج إلى تفكير يعني أنه قرار سهل حقًا بالنسبة لك إذا كنت قد فعلت شيئًا خاطئًا وتعترف أنه يمكنك القول إنني أفسدت نعم يا رفاق.,Arabic
أنا أعلم.,Arabic
أنا آسف.,Arabic
انا ثمل.,Arabic
هذا هو خطأي.,Arabic
لقد أخفقت في الأمر إذا كنت تريد أن يعمل شخص ما بدلاً مني.,Arabic
هل يمكنك تغطيني مثل هل يمكنك العمل بدلاً مني بينما أنا م رؤية صديقي.,Arabic
هل يمكنك أن تغطيني لقد حان وقت المغادرة ، ومن الأفضل أن أذهب يا رفاق مما يعني أنني يجب أن أذهب بالفعل.,Arabic
أنت تعلم.,Arabic
إنها في الواقع الساعة 1 9 مساءً.,Arabic
الآن.,Arabic
من الأفضل أن أذهب بطريقة أخرى لأقول وداعًا.,Arabic
أستطيع أن أقول اعتني بنفسك ، مما يعني اعتني بنفسك سوف اراك لاحقا.,Arabic

الخبز الذهبي في قرية صغيرة عاشت امرأة اسمها ماريون.,Arabic
مع ابنتها الوحيدة ، كانت narcisa ماريون متواضعة للغاية ولطيفة ، ولكن كان العكس تمامًا كما ترى ، كانت جميلة بما يتجاوز الكلمات التي كانت تعيشها.,Arabic
الدمية والجزء الأكثر إمتاعًا هو أنها أحببت نفسها بلا نهاية.,Arabic
ساعدني في خبز الخبز ، هاه بأي حال من الأحوال أمي الخادمات الطحين كل عيني المشرقة والمتألقة.,Arabic
narcisa ، هل ستساعدني في زرع هذه البذور ، فما الذي يجعلني أفعل ذلك ، ما الذي يجعل كل هذه الأوساخ على أصابعي الجميلة أسوأ ، ماذا لو كانت على وجهي جيدًا كانت هذه هي مشكلة Narcisa.,Arabic
لقد اعتقدت أنها أكبر من أن تقوم بأي عمل جاء العديد من الخاطبين لطلب يد النرجس للزواج.,Arabic
نظرًا لأن جمالها كان معروفًا على نطاق واسع لكنها رفضتهم جميعًا بوقاحة شديدة ، فلماذا طردت هؤلاء الرجال بعيدًا أمس بدوا لطيفين ، لا يمكنك أن تكون جادًا أمي واحد منهم.,Arabic
كان لديه عيون صغيرة مثل عصفور والآخر لديه أنف ضخم لا أريد أن أكون بالقرب منه عندما عطس أوه أوه والمحطة الأخيرة لا ، لا أريد أن أسمع أكثر من ذلك ، كل ما استطعت رؤيته هو أن هؤلاء الرجال كانوا لطفاء حقًا يا عزيزي ، يجب أن تعرف هذا الجمال.,Arabic
ليس كل شيء يا أم عليك أن تدرك أنني أستحق شخصًا مثل أمير أو فارس.,Arabic
يا عزيزتي ذات ليلة عندما كانت نائمة جلست والدتها بجانبها تراقبها.,Arabic
طفلي العزيز ، أنت جميلة ورائعة لكنك لا تهتم بأي شيء سوى جمالك.,Arabic
في تلك اللحظة بدأت النرجس بالضحك أثناء نومها كانت والدتها متفاجئة للغاية بمدى روعة حلمها المضحك في صباح اليوم التالي عندما كانت نرجس استيقظت كانت كل الابتسامات والضحكات هنا عزيزتي قل لي بماذا كنت تحلم.,Arabic
الليلة الماضية حسناً أمي ، لقد كان حلمًا رائعًا كما تعلم أن هناك هذا الأمير الذي جاء إلي.,Arabic
وقال إنه يريد أن يتزوجني لقد جاء في عربة ذهبية وكان يرتدي ملابس من أعلى إلى أسفل وذهب وكذلك يا له من حلم سخيف.,Arabic
وأنت تعرف أن أفضل جزء منه كان عندما كنت أرتدي فستان زفافي الذي كان من الذهب أيضًا بالطبع كان الجميع يحدق في أنا فقط ، لا يوجد شيء مدهش في هذا الحلم.,Arabic
لقد كان حلمًا مغرورًا جدًا يا أمي ، فأنت لا تعرف ما تقوله ، لقد جعلني الحلم أدرك أنني بحاجة إلى طعام أكبر بكثير من النوع الذي أتناوله هنا في المنزل ، خبز مصنوع من الذهب.,Arabic
مجرد التفكير في تلك الأم المسكينة النرجسية كانت قلقة للغاية بشأن ابنتها وكيف.,Arabic
كانت ستعيش حياتها في ذلك اليوم جاء صديقان لزيارة والدتهما النرجسية وهما ميلي وتيري ، كان الثلاثة منهم أصدقاء منذ زمن طويل ، لكن تيري وإيلي كان لديهما سر.,Arabic
كانوا كائنات سحرية شيئًا لم تعرفه والدة نارسيس شيئًا عن تيري ميلي ، من الجيد جدًا رؤيتك لقد مضى وقت طويل جدًا ' كيف حالك لقد كنت جيدًا جدًا ، كنت سأكون أفضل لو كانت ابنتي نرسيسا فقط أكثر تفهمًا قليلاً أخبرت ماريان ميلي وتيري كل شيء عن نارسيس وكيف كانت قلقة عليها تريد أن تأكل الخبز المصنوع من الذهب ماذا أفعل بها جيدًا ربما إذا تحقق حلمها سيكون ذلك رائعًا ، أليس كذلك جيدًا بغض النظر عن الوقت الذي أعتقد أنها ستنمو لتتعلم فلنتحدث عن شيء آخر.,Arabic
الآن لاحقًا في وقت لاحق ، لوح ميلي وتيري وداعًا لصديقهما القديم وذهبا مبتسمين لبعضهما البعض سرا في تلك الليلة كل من الأم وابنتها.,Arabic
استعدت للنوم يا أمي ، آمل حقًا أن يتحقق حلمي ، فأنت تعلم يا نارسسا في اليوم التالي حيث كانت نارسسا ووالدتها بالخارج في حديقتهم الجميلة.,Arabic
جاءت عربة ذهبية متجهة إليهم كانت مرصعة بالأحجار الكريمة والماس وتبدو مذهلة للغاية.,Arabic
عندما توقفت ، خرج منه رجل وسيم ونظر إلى نارسسا ، لقد فوجئت تمامًا بمدى وسيمه الذي كان حلمي يتحقق بالفعل.,Arabic
ما مرحباً جئت إلى هنا لأطلب الزواج من نرجس ولكن كيف تعرف اسمها ومن أنت.,Arabic
أنا مرعوب من ملاك الحظ السعيد اسم ابنتك وجمالها معروف في جميع أنحاء العالم هنا لقد أحضرت لك هدية ولكنك بالكاد تعرفه لا يمكنك الذهاب معه.,Arabic
يا سخيف ، إنه ثري ووسيم أكثر ما يمكن أن أريده أكثر من ذلك أنا أقبل اقتراحك.,Arabic
وبهذا دخلت عربته وبدون حتى أن تقول وداعًا لأمها انطلقت مع الملاك بينما كانوا يسافرون ، دخلت العربة فجأة إلى بوابة سحرية هناك ، سارت عبر منطقة عاصفة اصطدمت العربة حولها بشكل هائل ونرجسية.,Arabic
كنت خائفًا جدًا ، لا تقلق يا عزيزي ، فكل هذا سينتهي قريبًا تمامًا كما قال إن العربة مرت عبر بوابة أخرى ووصلت إلى الممر.,Arabic
من قلعة ذهبية ضخمة ورائعة ، كانت نارسيسا مندهشة من كل الجمال الذي رأته ، كنت أعرف أنني أستحق الكثير من الثروات ، كنت أعلم أنك ستعجبك أي شيء تريده ستجده هنا من أجمل الفساتين إلى ألذ الأطعمة كلها في قصري أتحدث جيدًا عن الطعام ، فأنا جائع حقًا بعد تلك الرحلة.,Arabic
أتضور جوعا هل يمكنني الحصول على أي من هذا الطعام اللذيذ بالطبع هنا ميليسا اللحم ذات الرائحة الكريهة ستحصل على كل ما تريد ، لقد سمعت الكثير عنك أنت يا مسكين عزيزي أنت جائع ، ألست تعال لنذهب إلى طاولة الطعام و سأحضر لك بعض الطعام ، شكرًا لك ، لقد ذهبوا إلى غرفة الطعام وكان هناك على الطاولة أكثر الأطعمة المدهشة التي شاهدها Narcisa على الإطلاق ، وهذا لأنه صنع المربيات.,Arabic
من الياقوت ، سلطات الزمرد والخبز الموجود هناك مصنوع من الخبز الذهبي الذهبي ، كم سيبدو هذا المربى جميلًا وطعمه الجميل مع الخبز الذي أخذت شريحة منه.,Arabic
مربى الياقوت عليها وأخذت قضمة كبيرة ، هذا حار جدًا ، لا يمكنني تناول هذا جيدًا ، إنه خبز مصنوع من الذهب والأفضل أيضًا ، لكن إذا لم تستطع تناوله ، فهل يجب أن أحضر لك خبزًا فضيًا فضيًا ، أليس كذلك؟ انت تأكل.,Arabic
شيء آخر ولكني أريد خبزًا عاديًا يمكنني تناوله ، أليس كذلك لديك هذا المظهر ، لذا فالزوجة المستقبلية لصدفة مولاي تكون باردة ، يجب عليك فقط تناول أفضل أنواع النرجس التي تنظر إليها جميع الأطعمة.,Arabic
لكن حزن القلب بسبب كل ما كان هناك غير صالح للأكل ، سرعان ما بدأت في البكاء لا أريد هذا ولكن الطعام جيد حقًا.,Arabic
هنا جرب بعض البطاطس الذهبية فهي جيدة حقًا وبعد أن تتزوجني.,Arabic
عليك أن تأكل كل هذا ، أعتقد أنك تحب الأشياء الفاخرة ، لا أريد أن أتزوجك أريد العودة إلى المنزل.,Arabic
إلى والدتي ، دعني أذهب إلى المنزل ميليسا ونظر تيرنس إلى بعضهما البعض وغمز بشكل جيد.,Arabic
إذا كان هذا هو ما تريده حقًا ، فسوف آخذك إلى المنزل ، حيث أخذ الفزع يبكي ويبكي.,Arabic
نارسيس في المنزل في العربة بدأت تفكر بعمق في الخيارات التي اتخذتها عندما وصلت إلى المنزل.,Arabic
ركضت لتعانق والدتها التي كانت جالسة في المنزل حزينة ولا أخت يا ابنتي الحلوة اعتقدت أنني لن أراك مرة أخرى.,Arabic
يا أمي ، أنا أحبك كثيرًا وكنت تبدو جيدًا والثروات ليست كل شيء كان الخبز الذهبي عديم الفائدة لأنني لم أستطع أكله والرجل رغم ذلك.,Arabic
لقد كان وسيمًا ولم يهتم بي على الإطلاق ولكن عزيزي هل تدرك أن هذه هي الطريقة التي تعاملت بها مع الآخرين وأنا أعلم أنني آسف جدًا للطريقة التي تصرفت بها أمي ، لا ، لا بأس بما أنك رأيت.,Arabic
ما هو خطأك ، فلنطعمك شيئًا لطيفًا من ذلك اليوم فصاعدًا.,Arabic
غيرت narcisa طرقها التي كافحت في البداية ولكن ببطء وصبر بدأت تصبح أجمل كثيرًا ذات يوم جاء ميلي وتيري لمقابلة ماريان مرة أخرى.,Arabic
كيف' أخبرتهم النرجسية الآن ماريان بكل ما حدث وتغيرت كثيرًا منذ ذلك الوقت.,Arabic
هل أعتقد أنها لن تريد المزيد من الخبز الذهبي الآن ، هاه تعلمون.,Arabic
تيري تبدو في الواقع مثل هذا الملاك قليلاً على الرغم من أن ما أراه كيف يمكن أن تكونا له أنتما لطيفان للغاية,Arabic
