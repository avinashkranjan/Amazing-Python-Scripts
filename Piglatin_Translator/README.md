# Pig Latin Translator
A secret language formed from English by transferring the initial consonant or consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable (usually /eɪ/): so pig Latin would be igpay atinlay

## Rules
1. If a word begins with a vowel, just as "yay" to the end. For example, "out" is translated into "outyay".
2. If it begins with a consonant, then we take all consonants before the first vowel and we put them on the end of the word. For example, "which" is translated into "ichwhay".
  
## How to run?
 
 - Run the script ```python piglatin.py```
 - Enter a Sentence you need to translate to pig latin
