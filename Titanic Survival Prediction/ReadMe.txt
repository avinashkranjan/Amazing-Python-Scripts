Titanic Survival Prediction using CatBoost:

Aim
Analyzing and predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using the CatBoost machine learning algorithm. The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, cabin class, fare, and more.

Details
The project involves preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numeric representations, and using the CatBoostClassifier to build a predictive model.
