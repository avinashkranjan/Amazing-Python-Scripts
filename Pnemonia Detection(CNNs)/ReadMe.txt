Pnuemonia Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

Aim
Implementation of a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect pneumonia from medical images, specifically chest X-rays.

Details
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that affects the lungs and can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. CNNs, a type of deep neural network designed to process and analyze visual data, are well-suited for image classification tasks like pneumonia detection.
