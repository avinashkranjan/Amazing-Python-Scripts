Text extraction form Images, OCR, Tesseract, Basic Image manipulation are all important yet very basic scripts.

This script uses ```pytesseract``` for text extraction from images, considering it only recognizes text and can 
only print it, this script additionally adds a functionality to write the text in a `txt` and/or `csv` file.

## Setup instructions

- Setup a `python 3.x` virtual environment.
- `Activate` the environment
- Install the dependencies using ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
- You are all set and the [script](text_extract.py) is Ready to run.
- Carefully follow the Instructions.

## Further Readings

Some newcomers for the first time struggle with Tesseract, this is a direct link to the 
[installer](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

Setting up OCR can be found [here](http://bit.ly/2MClAwD)

__PATH__ env variable can help in optimizing the code. 
[This](http://bit.ly/35d3c3Q) and [this](http://bit.ly/3ba0zmZ) link will help you in order to achieve that.

## Usage

Just make sure that Tesseract is in proper directory, run the code according the comments and guidelines.

```
Smaple - 
Enter the Folder name containing Images: <Name of Folder>
Enter your desired output location: <Name of Folder>
```
