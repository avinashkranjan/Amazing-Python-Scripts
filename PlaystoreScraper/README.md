# Google Playstore Scraper

- This script helps to scrape Google Playstore for a desired query relating to apps to obtain all relevant data regarding the resulting apps.

- In the  `fetch_apps.py` , we take user input for the query, and we fetch and store all the app information related to apps of this query in a database file.

- In the `display_apps.py` , we display the desired results from the database to the user.

## Setup instructions

- The requirements can be installed as follows:

```shell
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
