# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition

This project is a demonstration of a Hand Written Digit Recognition system. It uses machine learning techniques to recognize and classify handwritten digits.
Fed and trained on MNIST dataset using 5 layer convolution neural network.

The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at https://raghucharan16.github.io/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition/.

# Features
* Handwritten digit recognition: The system can recognize and classify handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.
* Web interface: Users can draw digits on the web canvas provided by the application.
* Real-time prediction: The application provides real-time predictions as the user draws the digit.
* Clear functionality: Users can clear the canvas to start a new drawing.
* Model details: The repository includes the trained model used for digit recognition.

# Usage
To use the Hand Written Digit Recognition system, follow these steps:

* Open the web application using the provided link: https://raghucharan16.github.io/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition/.
* Once the application is loaded, you will see a canvas on which you can draw digits using your mouse or touch input.
* Draw a digit on the canvas. As you draw, the application will display real-time predictions for the digit you are drawing.
* If you want to start a new drawing, click the "Clear" button to clear the canvas and predictions.
* Repeat steps 3-4 as desired.

# Development
If you are interested in contributing to this project or running it locally, follow these instructions:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/raghucharan16/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the application locally.

# Dependencies
The Hand Written Digit Recognition project relies on the following dependencies:

* HTML5 Canvas: Used for drawing and capturing user input.
* TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library for machine learning used for the digit recognition model(tensorflowjs works only when tensorflow version <1.6).
* Bootstrap: A CSS framework used for styling and layout.
* jQuery: A JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation and event handling.
* The required dependencies are already included in the project repository, so there is no need for additional setup.
