# LAPTOP PRICE PREDICTION

## Aim

The aim is to predict price of a laptop on the basis of various factors such as manufacturer, type of processor, processing speed(GHz),	Ram(gb), HDD(gb), SSD(gb), Graphics(gb) and ScreenSize(inch).

## ML Algorithm Used

Random Forest Regressor

A Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging. The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees.
Random Forest has multiple decision trees as base learning models. We randomly perform row sampling and feature sampling from the dataset forming sample datasets for every model. This part is called Bootstrap.
