# DOMINANT COLOR DETECTION FROM IMAGE 

## Introduction
1. Finding Dominant Colour: Finding Colour with Kmeans and giving appropriate colors to the
   pixel/data points of the image.
2. Analyse different K in K-means : Different Ks can give totally different results, and usually, there is one K which 
   is consistent with the data points, the actual K.
3. Good Segmentation(Colour Extraction) : Given an image in a generic viewpoint, we wish to produce the best possible
   segmentation, by this we mean that most people would choose this segmentation if asked to make one, and it would
   make a good precursor for object recognition.

## How to use it :

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Install Required Libraries

``` 
    pip install python-opencv
    pip install sklearn
    pip install pandas
    pip install matplotlib
    
    OR 
    
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run all the cells of Dominant color Extraction.ipynb
4. Output :Analyse the Dominant color in Image<br>
